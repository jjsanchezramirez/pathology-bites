## Usage

### Basic Implementation
```tsx
import { CellQuizGame, CellQuizTutorial } from '@/features/cell-quiz/components'

// Quiz game
<CellQuizGame 
  quizSet="myeloid"
  onComplete={(results) => console.log(results)}
  onExit={() => console.log('Exit quiz')}
/>

// Tutorial
<CellQuizTutorial 
  onComplete={() => console.log('Tutorial complete')}
/>
```

### Quiz Results
```typescript
interface QuizResults {
  correct: number    // Number of correct answers
  total: number     // Total questions (always 10)
  streak: number    // Best streak in this session
}
```

## Statistics Tracking

The quiz tracks the following metrics per category:
- **Accuracy percentage** (correct/total)
- **Total attempts** across all sessions
- **Current streak** (consecutive correct answers)
- **Best streak** (highest consecutive correct answers)

Statistics are persisted in localStorage as `cell-quiz-stats`.

## Educational Value

This tool helps users develop systematic cell identification skills by:
1. **Pattern recognition** through repeated exposure to cell morphology
2. **Feature analysis** with guided explanations of key characteristics
3. **Progressive learning** across different complexity levels
4. **Immediate reinforcement** with explanatory feedback

Perfect for medical students, residents, and laboratory professionals learning hematopathology.
