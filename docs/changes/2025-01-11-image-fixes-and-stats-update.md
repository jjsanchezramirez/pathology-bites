# Image Fixes and Stats Update - January 11, 2025

## Summary
Fixed critical image display issues in demo question component and updated public stats API to show actual question counts. Also updated copyright year to 2025.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Image Cropping Issues
**Problem**: Tall images were being cropped vertically at the bottom when zoomed.

**Root Cause**: Modal containers had fixed dimensions and images were forced to fill them, causing cropping.

**Solution**: Changed approach to let images determine their own size within viewport limits.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/features/images/components/image-carousel.tsx`
- `src/shared/components/common/improved-image-dialog.tsx` 
- `src/shared/components/common/simple-carousel.tsx`

**Technical Details**:
- **Before**: Container with `max-w-[90vw] max-h-[90vh]` + image with `w-full h-full`
- **After**: Image with `max-w-[90vw] max-h-[90vh]` + container adapts to image size

### 2. Fixed Demo Question Component Issues
**Problems**:
- Single image zoom caused page freezing
- Inconsistent behavior between single and multiple images
- Reference image lacked zoom capability
- Image description was inside image container

**Solutions**:
- Fixed positioning bug in `ImprovedImageDialog` by adding `relative` class
- Standardized to always use `ImageCarousel` for all images (single and multiple)
- Added zoom capability to reference images using `ImageCarousel`
- Moved reference image description outside container with proper spacing

**Files Modified**:
- `src/shared/components/common/demo-question.tsx`
- `src/shared/components/common/improved-image-dialog.tsx`

### 3. Fixed Public Stats API
**Problem**: Question count was showing fallback values instead of actual database counts.

**Solution**: Updated API to query database directly for published questions count.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/public/stats/route.ts`

**Changes**:
- Replaced dashboard view query with direct database counts
- Added proper error handling
- Returns actual counts instead of hardcoded fallbacks

### 4. Updated Copyright Year
**Files Modified**:
- `src/shared/components/layout/footer.tsx`

**Change**: Updated copyright from "© 2024" to "© 2025"
