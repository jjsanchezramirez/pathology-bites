with relatively high penetrance, but there are also several autosomal recessive conditionsTumors typically develop at younger age compared to sporadic counterpartsMultiple primary tumors can arise in affected organEnvironmental factors can modulate extent of cancer riskNew susceptibility genes continue to be identified, and many of these are lower penetranceGermline genetic testing standard of care for establishing diagnosis of most hereditary cancer syndromesBackground~ 10% of all cancers are attributable to inherited cancer predisposition geneIdentifying clinical features suggesting possibility of genetic predisposition to cancer is 1st step to diagnosing these syndromesStudies of rare familial clusters have been remarkably productive scientific and clinical approach providing 1st clues about genetics of these syndromesIdentification of 1st cancer susceptibility genes (i.e., RB1, APC)Molecular pathogenesis of hereditary tumors informed understanding of more common sporadic counterpartsFull spectrum of clinical phenotypes and specific genotype-phenotype correlations were definedSingle-gene hereditary syndromes account for only small fraction of familial clustering on population basisGenetics of many \"familial\" cases remain undefinedPathologists can often play important role in recognizing hereditary cancer syndromesImmunohistochemistry for DNA mismatch repair proteins can raise suspicion for Lynch syndromeCumulative colon adenoma count over time can raise suspicion for polyposis syndromeRecognizing hereditary cancer syndromes has several key clinical implicationsManagement of cancer may changeAltered surgical approach (i.e., more extensive colonic resection for colon cancer in Lynch syndrome)Selection of chemotherapy regimen (i.e., use of PARP-inhibitor in BRCA mutation-positive tumor)Cancer screening may be more intensive (higher frequency) and extensive (inclusion of multiple other organ systems)Risk-reducing operations may be option for individuals at high risk for certain cancersFamily members also at risk for these hereditary syndromes and should undergo counselingIdentification of At-Risk IndividualsAccurate identification of patients at increased risk for developing cancer is essentialObtaining careful family history of cancer is key 1st step and should be routine part of clinical practice2-generation pedigree should be obtained as minimum; 3 generations idealNow routine to pursue cancer genetics risk assessment, which includes option of germline mutation testing for relevant genesIdentification of individuals at risk for cancer has become integral part of medicineWill allow health care providers to intervene with appropriate clinical managementCounseling and educationIncreased cancer surveillanceCancer preventionGenetic risk assessment in context of childhood cancer is specific circumstance and requires participation of all family membersNational Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has established criteria for those individuals who should undergo further genetic risk assessmentMultiple algorithmic approach for tumor syndromes available onlinehttp://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/genetics_screeningGenetic testing should be offered to all patients with specific cancersNCCN currently recommends genetic testing for all patients with ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancerSuch \"universal\" approaches reduce burden of remembering clinical criteria for genetics referralThere is growing interest in germline genetic testing for all patients with any solid tumorCancer Susceptibility TestingASCO: Indications for TestingAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommends that genetic testing be offered whenIndividual has personal or family history features suggestive of genetic cancer susceptibility conditionTests can be adequately interpretedResults will aid in diagnosis or influence medical or surgical management of patient or family members at hereditary risk of cancerASCO recommends that genetic testing only be done in setting of pre- and posttest counseling, which should include discussion of possible risks and benefits of early cancer detection and prevention modalitiesASCO: Policy StatementAdvent of syndrome-specific germline mutation testing represents major advance in care of cancer-prone individualsASCO reaffirms its commitment to integrating cancer risk assessment and management, including molecular analysis of cancer predisposition genes, into practice of oncology and preventive medicineGenetic testing for cancer susceptibility has become accepted part of oncologic careGermline testing for inherited predisposition is well established as part of care of individuals who may be at hereditary risk for cancers of breast, ovary, colon, stomach, uterus, thyroid, and other primary sitesGermline genetic testing is distinct from somatic genetic profiling of cancer tissue to predict prognosis or treatment responseGermline testing involves analysis of DNA from blood or saliva for inherited mutations in specific genes that are associated with type of cancer seen in individual or family seeking assessmentWhen identified, such high-penetrance mutations usually result in significant alteration in function of corresponding gene product and are associated with large increases in cancer riskOther mutations result in less dramatic increases in risk (intermediate penetrance)Identification of high-penetrance mutation often justifies adjustment of clinical care through modification of surveillance or through preventive surgeryGermline testing for certain high-penetrance predispositions is now part of clinical guidelines and is reimbursed by most 3rd-party payersImpact of low- and moderate-penetrance mutations on clinical care is less clearASCO: Clinical Utility of Genetic TestingGenetic tests may benefit individuals by providing deeper self-knowledge and motivation to pursue healthy behaviors, even if results do not inform clinical decision makingTests for high-penetrance mutations in appropriate populations have clinical utility, meaning that they inform clinical decision making and facilitate prevention or amelioration of adverse health outcomesGenetic tests for intermediate-penetrance mutations and genomic profiles of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to low-penetrance variants are of uncertain clinical utilityASCO: Informed ConsentProposed elements of informed consent related to testing for inherited cancer susceptibility are set forthBasic elements of informed consent for cancer susceptibility testingInformation on specific genetic mutation(s) or genomic variant(s) being tested, including whether range of risk associated with variant will impact medical careImplications of positive and negative resultPossibility that test will not be informativeOptions for risk estimation without genetic or genomic testingRisk of passing genetic variant to childrenTechnical accuracy of test, including, where required by law, licensure of testing laboratoryFees involved in testing and counseling and, for direct-to-consumer (DTC) testing, whether counselor is employed by testing companyPsychological implications of test results (benefits and risks)Risks and protections against genetic discrimination by employers or insurersConfidentiality issues, including, for DTC testing companies, policies related to privacy and data securityPossible use of DNA testing samples in future researchOptions and limitations of medical surveillance and strategies for prevention after genetic or genomic testingImportance of sharing genetic and genomic test results with at-risk relatives so that they may benefit from this informationPlans for follow-up after testingSpecial Issues Related to Genetic Testing ResearchProspective clinical trials, large registries, and retrospective reviews are most accurate methods forDeriving relative risks of genetic variantsMeasuring response to and effectiveness of clinical interventions based on genetic cancer risk assessmentTests with uncertain clinical utility have become commercially availableCrucial to establish evidence-based algorithm for clinically responsible use of these testsWherever possible, genetic tests with uncertain clinical utility should be administered in context of clinical trialsResearch should include basic studies of functional significance of genetic variants linked to disease risk as well as prospective, randomized controlled trials of individual genomic markersAt translational level, important to establish criteria for technologic assessment of genetic and other diagnostic testsResearch should focus on extent to which personal benefits accrue to individuals who receive tests that have uncertain clinical utilityEstablishing evidence-based test for personal utility is particularly important for tests that would not be recommended based on clinical utilityResearch is also needed to demonstrate validity and reproducibility of some commercially available testsBecause algorithms used to convert genotypes into absolute risk estimates are empirically derived, prospective research is needed to confirm calibration of these estimates and to measure effectiveness of interventions based on individual genomic profilingIf genetic and genomic tests for cancer risk are going to be offered or justified on basis of personal utility, effort should be made to establish evidence-based tests for these claimsGenetic CounselingGenetic testing should be conducted only in setting of pre- and posttest counselingPretest counselingAllows for advance consideration of possible test results, medical options, and impact test results may have on family membersPermits discussion of pros/cons of which genetic test to orderSingle gene analysisAnalysis of several genes associated with specific syndromeAnalysis of panel of genes associated with specific tumor typeAnalysis of comprehensive panel of genes associated with multiple tumor typesPosttest counselingProvides valuable opportunity for health care providers to

or other influences~ 10% of cancer develops in setting of hereditary predisposition and is largely caused by inherited genetic variant in genes that predispose to familial cancer syndromes> 50 Mendelian hereditary cancer syndromes with very high risk of cancer> 100 Mendelian hereditary cancer syndromes with predisposition to cancerAdvancements in genetic testing and population-based studies suggest this proportion is increasingProportion of cancer cases with hereditary background is steadily increasingFamilial refers to occurrence of cancer (i.e., phenotype) with greater frequencies in families than in general population\"Familial\" and \"hereditary\" are frequently used synonymouslyAdvancements in polygenic risk scores (PRS) provide nuanced risk stratification for individuals with low-penetrance variantsPRS tools integrate multiple genetic variants, offering more personalized risk assessment, especially for breast and prostate cancersOccurrence patterns that raise likelihood of familial cancer syndromeMany cases of same type of cancerCancer occurring at younger age than usual> 1 type of cancer in single personCancer occurring in both pairs of organ (e.g., both breasts; bilateral distribution)> 1 childhood cancer in siblingsCancer occurring in sex not usually affected (e.g., breast cancer in men)Cancer occurring in many generationsGermline mutation is another way to refer to inherited mutation because these mutations occur in specialized tissues that give rise to germ/sex cells (i.e., sperm or oocytes) and can be transmitted to next generationFamily HistoryCan help identify individuals at risk for developing cancer1st-degree relatives include individual's parents, children, and brothers and sisters, including half-brothers and half-sisters2nd-degree relatives include grandparents, aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews, and grandchildren3rd-degree relatives include first cousins, great grandparents, great aunts and uncles, and great grandchildrenEmerging Syndromes and Expanded IndicationsNew familial cancer syndromes continue to be identified and refined3 classes of mesenchymal tumors with DICER1 alterations have been termed LGMT DICER1, SARC DICER1, and PIS DICER1 based on methylation data enabling meaningful treatment optionsGermline CDH1 mutations are found in lobular breast cancer (LBC) not associated with classical hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome leading to criteria for screening and managing high-risk patientsGENETICS OF FAMILIAL CANCERGermline vs. Somatic VariantsMost germline variants are present in 100% of cells, including both nonmalignant and tumor cells leading to allelic fractions of 0.5 or 1.0 in both tissue componentsMosaicism in genes, such as TP53, has emerged as important consideration for atypical presentations of Li-Fraumeni syndromeSomatic variants are acquired after birth and result from either errors in DNA repair or replication, and allelic fractions in tumors are usually < 0.5 due to presence of nonmalignant tissue within tumorAllelic fractions > 0.5 may indicate loss of heterozygosity, such as deletion of complementary alleleFamilial cancer syndromes often present and 1st come to clinical attention as primary tumor in some familiesIn these instances, genetic analysis of tumor often identifies several pathogenic variants, including variants in known familial cancer syndrome genes (e.g., BRCA1 or TP53)Laboratories must correctly distinguish somatic variants from germline variants in cancer patients due to serious clinical consequences for patientPaired normal-tumor sequencing increasingly utilized to determine if variant is germlineClinical features can also be used to help determine whether origin of variants is germline or somaticAlleleHumans have 2 copies of each genes at same locus because we inherit 1 copy from each parentEach copy differs in sequence &/or structure and are considered variants of each otherAllele is used to distinguish variant forms of gene, and, accordingly, individuals inherit 2 alleles of each geneConsequently, men have only 1 copy (and therefore 1 allele) of genes on their X and Y chromosomesAlleles of same gene may be fully functional, completely defective, or functional at some level between these extremesVariant\"Variant\" should be used in place of mutation and polymorphism\"Mutation\" and \"polymorphism\" often lead to confusion because of incorrect assumptions of pathogenic and benign effects, respectivelyMutation is permanent change in nucleotide sequencePolymorphism is variant with frequency > 1% in populationTools like ClinVarMiner streamline classification and reclassification of variantsInheritance PatternsAutosomal dominance (AD) inheritance occurs when pathogenic variant is present in 1 copy of familial cancer-associated gene (i.e., individual is heterozygous for pathogenic variant)In AD diseases, risk is increased when 1 pathogenic allele is inheritedAutosomal recessive (AR) inheritance occurs when pathogenic variant is present in both copies of gene (i.e., individual is homozygous for pathogenic variant)Pathogenic variant present in each gene is not necessarily same variant, and this situation is referred to as compound heterozygosityIn AR disease, 2 pathogenic alleles must be inherited for increased risk of diseaseLoss of HeterozygosityRepresents \"2nd hit\" of remaining functional allele in patients who inherited defective familial cancer geneOccurs by interstitial deletion, mitotic recombination, or nondisjunction of remaining functional allele leading its deletion &/or functional inactivationRepresents most common mechanism by which remaining functional allele is disruptedAlternative mechanisms include somatic mutation or epigenetic alteration of functional allele as 2nd hitTumor suppressor genes are frequently inactivated in familial cancer syndromesGENETIC VARIANTSSimple VariantsOne

hereditary originMajority of these diseases are inherited in autosomal dominant fashionAwareness of important manifestations associated with each syndrome that might provide additional clues to hereditary/familial neoplasia syndrome is importantRecognizing and identifying hereditary diseases during routine medical practice is neededHereditary Syndromes: Practical Guide to Pathological RecognitionSignificant proportion of hereditary neoplasia displays distinct/unusual histopathological &/or immunophenotypic features that make pathologists 1st medical specialists to recognize their inherited natureRole of pathologist resides in suspecting/recognizing inherited tumors and alerting clinicians to possibility of inherited predispositionAll patients identified as having familial tumors should be screened for mutation associated with familial diseaseGeneticists and clinicians should perform additional clinical and genetic evaluation for confirmationIt is becoming increasingly well recognized that given familial tumor syndrome may be very heterogeneous in clinical appearanceAs molecular diagnostic testing for these familial diseases has become more readily available, heterogeneous clinical appearance seen in many syndromes has become better recognizedDiverse neoplasias are common finding in patients with genetic predisposition to cancerPatients without overt clinical signs of underlying syndrome may present initially for treatment of tumorIdentification of hereditary cases and early diagnosis makes preventive surgery and adequate treatment possibleMost patients with familial disease are asymptomatic and discovered through genetic screening in predisposing familiesVast majority of tumors occurring in familial setting are multiple, bilateral, and involve multiple organsRecognition of Morphological Characteristics Indicating Familial Tumor SyndromesAwareness of pathologic features of neoplasms seen in variety of hereditary/familial neoplasia

specific gross and microscopic findings that suggest possible syndromic associationSome tumors frequently display characteristic clinical, biochemical, and histopathological features that, although not pathognomonic, can be helpful in suggesting inherited disease as underlying etiology and distinguishing these tumors from sporadic casesCharacteristic and distinct pathologic findings should alert pathologists to possible familial cancer syndromeCorrect histologic interpretation may lead to further molecular genetic evaluation of patient and family membersPathology ReportingIf constellation of pathologic findings strongly suggests potential syndromic associationConsult medical records for diagnosis of potential syndromePathologists should notify clinicians about this possibility, consider appropriate molecular testingFor reporting purposes, diagnosis of lesion or neoplasm should use same criteria and terminology as for sporadic lesions and tumorsComment suggesting possible association with genetic disease is recommendedTo document possibility of specific genetic associationFinal diagnostic commentary to highlight differential diagnostic issues that frequently arise when these diagnoses are consideredHereditary/Familial Syndromes Associated With NeoplasiaHereditary SyndromesSome hereditary syndromes are known to be associated with neoplasia and have unique &/or

and BRCA2 were 1st discovered by Dr. Mary-Claire King and colleagues by recognizing that breast cancers arising in young women were more likely to be associated with germline mutationBRCA1 was localized to chromosomal site in 1990 and BRCA2 in 1994These genes confer increased risk for breast cancer as well as other cancers for both women and menPresence of germline BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation affects screening, surgical procedures, and systemic therapy selectionMajority of cancers associated with BRCA1 are both tissue and tumor-type specificBreast: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) defined by lack of expression of ER, PR, and HER2BRCA1 cancers are also typically basal-like carcinomas, which are defined by mRNA expression (this group overlaps with TNBC by ~ 80%)Ovary: High-grade serous carcinoma; majority are thought to arise from fimbriated end of fallopian tubeBoth cancers share similarities in gene expression and mutation profiles (e.g., frequent TP53 mutations, MYC amplification and overexpression, and RB1 loss)Very specific increased risk for these 2 types of cancer is not completely understoodOne proposal is that higher estrogen levels due to diminished BRCA1 protein (which is negative regulator of estrogen) stimulates growth of progenitor cellsER-negative progenitor cells in breast may have their growth stimulated due to paracrine effects on other ER-positive epithelial cellsOther possibilities are under investigationEpidemiologyPopulation Incidence~ 1 in 300 (~ 0.1-0.3%)BRCA2 mutations found in ~ 0.1-0.7%Founder mutations present at increased

sporadic carcinomas, but this has not been supported by all studiesPrognosis may be related to higher sensitivity to drugs that cause DNA damage (platinum agents)BRCA1-associated TNBC is more likely to undergo pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (~ 46%) compared to TNBC not associated with BRCA1 (~ 27%)Patients who achieved pCR had improved survival compared to patients who did notPrecursor lesionsDefinite precursor lesion has not been identifiedProposed (but not proven) possible precursors includeHistologically normal cells with uniform p53 expression (analogous to

CancersProstate: Possibly increased but lower than for BRCA2Pancreas: Possibly increased but lower than for BRCA2Screening for BRCA1Population to Be TestedRecommendations for persons to be tested have broadened due to importance of identifying germline mutationsAffected individuals can take steps to reduce risk of subsequent cancers or to detect them at early stageCarcinomas associated with BRCA1 mutations are being treated with specific therapiesFamily members may also be at riskAffected individuals can choose to not pass mutation to their offspring with assisted reproductionCriteria have been developed to identify individuals with increased likelihood of germline mutation using following informationPersonal history of cancer, age at diagnosis, number of cancers, member of group with known increased incidence (e.g., Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry)Family history of cancer, age at diagnosis, number of cancers, identified germline mutationsPathologic features of cancers (type, presence of BRCA1 mutation)Weighted scoring systems are available to determine risk, including BRCAPRO, Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA), and Manchester Scoring SystemBRCAPRO available at http://www4.utsouthwestern.edu/breasthealth/cagene/BOADICEA available at http://astor.som.jhmi.edu/BayesMendel/brcapro.htmlAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and others have issued recommendations for testingGenetic TestingMultigene panel testing has become more common than testing for single genesFor women meeting NCCN guidelines for testing for BRCA1/BRCA2, ~ 10% will be found to have germline mutationHowever, only ~ 1/3 of tested individuals will have mutation in BRCA1/BRCA2; remainder have mutations in other genesIn addition, ~ 6% of individuals with BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutations do not meet criteria for testingThus, multigene testing can be helpful to detect major germline mutations conferring increased risk for breast cancerComprehensive testing by certified lab is necessary to detect all current gene variants known to increase cancer riskFull sequencing is required to detect all mutationsAdditional testing required to detect deletions and amplificationsDirect to consumer testing (not comprehensive)Assays for cancer risk marketed directly to individuals are generally not comprehensiveTypically only include most common mutations (e.g., 3 BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations common in Ashkenazi Jewish populations)In one study, 40% of results from direct to consumer testing could not be validated by certified laboratoryInterpretation of ResultsAlterations in BRCA1 may be variant with no increased risk, variant that greatly increases risk, or significance may currently be unknownIdeally, testing includes both pre- and posttest genetic counseling to help determine best type of testing and interpret resultsPathogenic variants (true positive)Some mutations are well documented to increase cancer risk in multiple members in affected familiesHelpful to test multiple members of families with newly detected variant in order to establish linkageNonpathogenic variants (true negative)Results show normal sequence or benign polymorphismThese include point mutations that do not alter type of amino acidVariants of uncertain significance (VUS) (inconclusive)Some alterations have not yet been linked to individuals with breast or ovarian cancerDetected in 7% of individuals tested (> 1,500 identified)More frequent in populations of non-European origin, as fewer individuals have been studiedVUS is problematic for individuals without personal or family history of cancer because linkage cannot be determinedMedical Care of Individuals With BRCA1 Germline MutationsOverviewIdentification of BRCA1 germline mutation can have important implications for medical careNotification of relatives at possible risk, childbearing, chemoprevention, screening systemic therapy, and prophylactic surgeryChemopreventionOral contraceptivesReduce risk of ovarian cancer by 50%Breast cancer risk may be increased by some types of oral contraceptives (results of studies have not been consistent)TamoxifenReduces riskEvidence derives from observed 50% reduction in risk of contralateral cancer among mutation carriers treated with tamoxifenProtective effect observed in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriersBRCA1 carriers appear to benefit despite predilection to develop ER-negative tumor for reasons that remain unclearBreast ScreeningAnnual mammograms, MR imaging, and clinical breast examination are recommendedHowever, for women with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations undergoing regular screening, 15% of malignancies can be interval cancers (cancers detected as palpable mass between screens)Compared to screen-detected cancers, interval cancers are larger, present at higher stage, and are more likely to be associated with positive lymph nodesMammography and MR may alternate every 6 months in order to reduce length of interval between screeningProphylactic SurgeryBilateral mastectomy reduces breast cancer risk by 97%However, not all breast tissue can be removed and achieve acceptable cosmetic resultsGreatest benefit for patients before diagnosis of cancerAfter cancer has been diagnosed, there may be no benefit if distant metastases are presentClinically and radiologically occult carcinoma is found in 1-15% of patientsCancers are most often DCIS or small invasive carcinomas with negative lymph nodesBilateral salpingo-oophorectomy reduces breast and ovarian cancer riskBreast cancer risk reduced by 50%Mechanism not well understood but may be due to decreased estrogen productionOvarian and fallopian tube cancer risk reduced by 50-96%4-5% risk of

cells with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation, inhibition of PARP causes cell death due to accumulation of irreparable DNA damage (synthetic lethality)In clinical trials, PARPi demonstrate encouraging efficacy in BRCA-mutated BCsBased on trials, American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommends 1 year of adjuvant PARPi in HER2 (-) BRCA1/BRCA2-mutated BC following initial therapyClinical Implications and Ancillary TestsPopulation To Be TestedASCO recommends that patients with > 10% mutation risk undergo testing85% of carriers will be detected using this 10% cutoffNational Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in United Kingdom recommends testing individuals with > 20% mutation riskCounseling should occur before testing to ensure patients are aware of implications for themselves and their familiesClinical CriteriaHistory of BC in women < 40 years of ageBC in 1st-degree relatives (mother, sister, daughter)Risk increased if BC diagnosed at young ageRisk increased if individuals have multiple BCsRisk increased if male with BC in familyRisk increased if ovarian cancer also present in familyRisk increased if relative has known mutationCalculating RiskMultiple models to predict probability of individual carrying germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutationEmpiric modelsDo not make assumptions about genetic risks (e.g., mutation frequency, mode of inheritance, penetrance)Examples include Penn II model, Myriad II (Frank) model, and National Cancer Institute modelGenetic risk prediction modelsMake assumptions about number of genes and allele frequenciesInclude information about

achieve acceptable cosmetic resultsGreatest benefit for patients prior to BC diagnosisAfter BC has been diagnosed, there may be no benefit if distant metastases are presentBilateral salpingo-oophorectomy reduces breast and ovarian cancer riskBC reduced by 50%Mechanism not well understood but may be due to decreased estrogen productionOvarian and fallopian tube cancer reduced by

hyperparathyroid syndromeFIHP characterized by overactivity of parathyroid glands≥ 1 overactive parathyroid gland(s) release excess PTH, which causes hypercalcemiaLatest concepts of FIHP focus upon kindreds without mutation of either MEN1, CASR, or CDC7315-20% have germline-activating mutation of gene for GCM2 transcription factorHistorically, genetically heterogeneous and associated with mutations in different genes: MEN1, CDC73, CASR, and recently GCM2With increasing follow-up, many individuals thought to have familial isolated hyperparathyroidism developed extraparathyroid syndrome or featuresPTH stimulates removal of calcium from bone and absorption of calcium from dietParathyroid glands produce excess PTHFIHP is mainly due to 4-gland parathyroid disease or single-gland adenomaEpidemiologyAge RangeChildhood to adulthoodSexF ~ MIncidence~ 90% of hyperparathyroidism cases are sporadic~ 10% of hyperparathyroidism cases are familialFIHP accounts for 1% of PHPTRemainder

rate of biochemical cure, and risk of parathyroid carcinomaGermline missense GCM2 variants occur in general population but are significantly overrepresented in individuals with PHPT with multiglandular or familial parathyroid disease compared to general populationPenetrance of GCM2 variants is low, thus most individuals in general population with GCM2 variants will not develop

hereditary PHPT, such as MEN1, MEN2, MEN3, HPT-JT, and FHHFew cases per kindred are identified, possibly due to low penetrance of disease, or more likely lack of screening in small families with FIHPClinical ImplicationsPresentation1st indication of condition is elevated calcium levels identified through routine blood testEven though affected individual may not yet have signs or symptoms of hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemiaBecause excess PTH is caused by abnormalities of parathyroid glands, FIHP is considered form of PHPTTypically, only 1 of 4 parathyroid glands is affected, but > 1 gland involved in some casesTumors are usually adenomasPatients with FIHP may develop parathyroid carcinomaIn contrast to sporadic PHPT, FIHP is characterized by earlier onset of disease, higher incidence of multiglandular involvement, and higher recurrence rateDisruption of normal calcium balance from overactive parathyroids causes signs and symptoms of FIHPKidney stones, nausea, vomiting, hypertension, fatigue, and osteoporosisTreatmentParathyroid surgery is treatment of choice, especially when disorder is complicated by symptomatic hypercalcemia, bone loss or fractures, hypercalciuria, and nephrolithiasisSubtotal parathyroidectomy is recommended for multiglandular involvementAssociated ConditionsPrimary Multiglandular Parathyroid Disease4-gland parathyroid disease is

mutations (IVS4 + 4A>T) (carrier frequency of 1.1%)Accounts for ~ 20% of cases of childhood aplastic anemiaAge75% diagnosed between 3-14 years of age10% diagnosed at ≥ 16 years of ageETIOLOGY/PATHOGENESISMolecular PathogenesisMutations, mostly biallelic in any of (at least) 23 separate genes composing FA pathway (FANCA-FANCU)Collectively, proteins encoded by these genes serve to sense DNA damage [interstrand crosslinks (ICLs)] and initiate DNA repairFA pathway proteins fall into 3 separate groups, encoded by following genesFA core complex (core complex detects DNA damage and ubiquitinates ID complex proteins)FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, FANCMFANCA is most frequently mutated gene in this complex (mutations account for ~ 65% of FA cases)Mostly large, intragenic deletions, though point mutations, smaller insertions/deletions, and splicing mutations also occur frequentlyFounder mutations have been described for specific populations, i.e., p.C295T mutation in Spanish Romani, who have highest carrier frequency of FA in world (carrier frequency of 1/64-70)Patients with 2 mutations leading to null alleles have earlier onset of hematologic abnormalities and shorter survival than patients with at least 1 hypomorphic mutationFANCC mutations account for 10-15% of FA casesLess severe hematologic course except for mutations IVS4+4A>T, p.Arg548Ter, and p.Leu554Pro, which have more congenital anomalies and earlier onset of hematologic abnormalitiesFANCG mutations account for ~ 10% of FA casesMore severe cytopenias and higher rates of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML)c.637-643delTACCGCC mutation is considered founder mutation responsible for > 80% of FA cases in Black South African populationID complex

controlGenotype-phenotype correlationsSome FANCC mutations predispose to early-onset bone marrow failureIncidence of AML and severe cytopenias is higher in patients with some FANCG and FANCA mutationsPatients with biallelic inactivating mutations in BRCA2 (FANCD1) have 97% cumulative incidence of midline brain tumors, Wilms tumor, and AML (or T-ALL) by 6 years of ageAncillary TestsConfirmation of DiagnosisCytogenetic testingDiagnostic test: Chromosomal breakage/stress cytogenetic test (typically off peripheral blood T lymphocytes)Cells are stimulated and exposed to diepoxybutane &/or mitomycin C and arrested at mitosisNumber of chromosomal breaks and radial formations is counted (in FA, these significantly exceed normal controls)If negative, consider testing nonhematopoietic cells (e.g., cultured skin fibroblasts) because hematopoietic cells can sometimes undergo reversion mutations, which correct original mutation (hematopoietic mosaics)Cannot detect FA carriers with this testCan be performed prenatally (amniotic fluid cells or chorionic villous biopsy)Molecular testingSequence analysis and targeted mutation analysisInitial test should consist of single gene sequencing of FANCA, which is most likely to be affectedCarrier and prenatal testing can be performed by specific mutation testing if familial mutation is knownCell cycle analysis/flow cytometry is alternative to chromosomal breakage test (cells with impaired DNA repair undergo G2 arrest following DNA cross-linking agent exposure)Evaluation for Hematologic MalignancyBone marrow biopsy: Morphologic evaluation is gold standard for diagnosis of MDSCytogenetic analysis: Clonal amplification of chromosome 3q26-q29 often precedes progression to MDS/AMLMost common cytogenetic

25% (30% for MDS and 10% for AML); median age at diagnosis: 11-14 yearsPredominantly myeloid malignancies (600x increased risk of AML; 5,000x increased risk of MDS)In ~ 25% of cases, leukemia (or

ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome (ATXPC) and myelodysplasia and leukemia syndrome with monosomy 7 (MLSM7)Monosomy 7 is common and often results in loss of mutated alleleIn cis mutations and other genetic mechanisms [UPD(7q)], can cause reversion of germline mutationsBone marrow failure and cytopenias occur in childhood with frequent dysplastic features, -7 karyotype, and high risk of MDS and AMLScreening should be considered in pediatric patients with MDS, AML, or JMML and chromosome 7 aberrationsAnalyses should include sequencing of DNA from peripheral blood as well as nonhematopoietic tissueAcute lymphoblastic leukemia with germline predispositionB-acute lymphoblastic leukemia with germline PAX5 mutationOnly few patients with PAX5 germline variants predisposing to familial B-ALL have been described in literature2nd somatic hit affecting wildtype PAX5 allele; seems necessary for leukemogenesis (somatic uniparental disomy or 2nd structural variant)B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia with germline IKZF1 mutation~ 1% of B-ALL (~ 15% of B-ALL have somatic IKZF1 mutations)Germline mutations are distributed across entire length of IKAROS proteinSeveral of germline variants also reduce responsiveness to both conventional chemotherapeutic agents as well as kinase inhibitorsGeneticsGeneral PointsUnderlying genetic cause of many clusters of familial MDS/AML have not yet been elucidatedGiven variable penetrance and latency periods, single germline mutations that have been described likely predispose to MDS/AML by rendering families highly susceptible to additional somatic mutationsTranscription Factor MutationsRUNX1 mutation in FPD/AMLRUNX1 (a.k.a. AML1, CBFA2)RUNX1 (21q22.3) encodes α-subunit of core binding factor transcription factor, which plays role in normal hematopoiesis and myeloid differentiationNumber of RUNX1 mutations have been described in FPD/AML (large intragenic deletions, Runt domain mutations) and tend to be specific to families; mutational heterogeneity may be reason for variable phenotypeRUNX1 mutations/translocations also occur in sporadic cases of MDS/AMLCEBPA mutationCCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (CEBPA)CEBPA (19q13.1) encodes transcription factor (C/EBPα) that can act as homodimer or heterodimer with C/EBPβ and C/EBPγ and plays role in myeloid differentiationCEBPA mutations also occur in sporadic cases of AMLCEBPA point mutations are commonly biallelic (2 acquired in sporadic AML, 1 germline and 1 acquired in familial AML) manifesting as dominant-negative N-terminal mutation and C-terminal mutation (in familial AML, germline mutation is always N-terminal mutation)GATA2 mutationGATA binding protein 2 (GATA2)GATA2 (3q21.3) encodes member of GATA family of zinc-finger transcription factors (named for promoter consensus sequence to which they bind) and plays role in hematopoiesis and other nonhematopoietic processes> 30 mutations in GATA2 have been described in sporadic and familial MDS/AML, MonoMac and Emberger (e.g., missense, non-sense, frameshift, small and large deletions)Aberrant activation or overexpression of GATA2 has also been described in de novo AML3 mutations have been seen in multiple families with varying phenotypesC.1-200_871 + 527del (Met1_Ser290del) has been described in familial MonoMac and in familial MDS (1 MonoMac patient also demonstrated unilateral lymphedema)C.1061 C > T (Thr354Met) has been described in familial MonoMac, familial MDS, and familial MDS/AML (no evidence of lymphedema in these patients)C.1187 G > A (Arg398Gln) has been described in familial MonoMac, familial MDS, and familial AML (no evidence of lymphedema in these patients)GATA2 has been shown to play role in lymphatic vasculature developmentLymphedema may occur secondary to significant GATA2 gene abnormalities (non-sense or frameshift mutations, partial or complete deletions) causing haploinsufficiency, as have been described in Emberger syndrome and de novo MDS/AML with lymphedemaAdditionally Reported Genetic AbnormalitiesTelomere maintenance mutations: Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and telomerase RNA component (TERC) mutations have been described in 5 families with MDS/AML (most also with AA) but lacking phenotypic characteristics of bone marrow failure syndrome dyskeratosis congenita (variable penetrance;

truncating (frameshift and nonsense), and many involve exons 1, 2, and 7CDC73-related disordersCDC73 transcript spans 2.7 kbCDC73 protein (parafibromin) binds RNA polymerase II associated factor (hPAF) as part of PAF1 transcriptional regulatory complex involved in DNA transcription and mediates H3K9 methylation silencing expression of protooncogene CCND1 (encoding cyclin-D1) and cMYC, leading to apoptosis inhibition and cell cycle progressionParafibromin may also interact with Wnt pathway effector β-cateninCDC73 mutation in HPT-JT and familial isolated hyperparathyroidismSomatic-inactivating CDC73 mutations occur in some sporadic parathyroid carcinomasUp to 75% have CDC73 inactivation but may be higher as mutations may be outside coding region

burden, and may have poorer outcomes than carcinomas with wildtype CDC73CDC73 encodes protein known as parafibromin (CDC73)CDC73 mutation results in truncated parafibrominCDC73 has strong association with mutation in familial and sporadic parathyroid carcinomaCDC73 mutation is uncommon in sporadic adenomasCDC73 mutation is not diagnostic of malignancy in parathyroid, as germline CDC73 mutation

central area with ossified rimBone scan: Increased uptake of affected bonesMACROSCOPICGeneral FeaturesParathyroid adenoma, atypical parathyroid tumor, and carcinoma usually present as single enlarged parathyroidParathyroid adenoma is single enlarged gland, tan to pink-tan, encapsulated ± rim of normal tissueSize: < 1 cm to > 10 cm; weight: 0.2 g to > 1.0 gCystic change may occur in adenomas, particularly larger adenomas, and in those with HPT-JTCystic change historically thought to be common feature, but it is not seen in majority of casesLarger adenomas may show fibrosis, hemosiderin, cystic degeneration, and calcificationAtypical parathyroid tumorSingle enlarged parathyroid glandParathyroid carcinomas are generally larger than atypical parathyroid tumor but overlap in sizeCan be difficult to differentiate atypical parathyroid tumor from carcinoma grossly and surgicallyLobulated appearance due to thick, fibrous bandsLarge tumors can be fibrotic, adhere to adjacent structuresParathyroid carcinomas may be large, firm, variably encapsulated, poorly circumscribedLarge tumors (mean: 6.7 g; range: 1.5 g to > 50 g)Carcinomas are often larger than adenomas and atypical parathyroid tumors but overlap in sizeLobulated appearance due to thick, fibrous bandsMay be grossly encapsulated, resemble adenomaMay adhere or invade adjacent structuresCaution as large adenomas, especially cystic, can be fibrotic and adhere to adjacent structuresOssifying fibroma shows central pink-yellow fibrous tissue surrounded by pale yellow, dense, peripheral ossified tissueMICROSCOPICGeneral FeaturesHyperparathyroidismSmall but significant number of parathyroid gland excisions may be due to heritable diseaseHistologic features of parafibromin-deficient parathyroid tumors include sheet-like growth, staghorn vessels with arborizing vasculature, nuclear enlargement, occasional multinucleation, perinuclear cytoplasmic clearing, and eosinophilic cytoplasmCaused by parathyroid adenoma, atypical parathyroid tumor, or carcinomaCystic changes may occurParathyroid adenoma, atypical parathyroid tumor, and parathyroid carcinoma are all hypercellularFibrosis, if present in adenoma, is usually focal but more extensive and often intratumoral or peritumoral in atypical parathyroid tumor and carcinomaFibrous bands can occur in adenoma but are more prominent in atypical parathyroid tumor and carcinomaFibrosis and hemosiderin with prior trauma to parathyroid, such as from needle biopsyThickened capsule can be seen in adenoma, atypical parathyroid tumor, and parathyroid carcinomaTumor cells may be entrapped in capsule, but invasion requires definitive growth through capsuleIn adenoma and atypical parathyroid tumor, cells do not extend beyond capsule into soft tissue or adjacent structures as may be seen in carcinomaMust differentiate invasion from entrapped cellsNecrosis is usually only seen in parathyroid carcinomaMitotic figures can be seen in adenoma, atypical parathyroid tumor, and carcinoma but are most prominent in carcinomaKi-67 > 5% is more common in carcinoma than adenoma and atypical parathyroid tumorAtypical mitotic figures only in carcinomaTumor cells are usually chief cells but can have oncocytic cells and transitional cellsCytologic atypia is usually seen in parathyroid carcinoma, but it is not definitive of malignancyCytologic atypia must be differentiated from \"endocrine atypia\" in benign parathyroid diseaseGrowth patterns may be variable, but monotonous, sheet-like, and trabecular growth are concerning features often seen in parathyroid carcinomaVascular invasion is only seen in parathyroid carcinomaCaution in differentiating vascular invasion from artifactual dislodgement of tumor

synaptophysinPTH and GATA3 are positiveKeratin is positive, particularly CAM5.2Negative for TTF-1, thyroglobulin, calcitonin (usually), and monoclonal PAX8p27, E-cadherin, 5hmC, BCL2, MDM2, and p53 may be helpful, particularly when used in combinationsKi-67 is < 5% in benign parathyroid disease, while parathyroid carcinoma often has Ki-67 of > 5%No individual biomarker is definitive, but combination of multiple markers may be helpfulParafibrominEncoded by CDC73, parafibromin often shows complete nuclear absence in carcinoma (familial and sporadic) and is retained in sporadic adenomas and sporadic atypical parathyroid tumorsIn HPT-JT, parathyroid disease, whether benign or malignant, usually shows loss of nuclear parafibromin reflecting underlying CDC73 mutationParafibromin-deficient neoplasm: Tumor showing complete absence of nuclear parafibromin staining in all tumor cells with preserved staining in nonneoplastic cellsPartial loss or reduction of parafibromin staining rather than complete nuclear absence of parafibromin may raise possibility of CDC73 deficiency but can be due to technical issuesLoss of nucleolar parafibromin only with retained nuclear staining may be associated with CDC73 mutation, but this remains less certainAs loss of nucleolar parafibromin expression does suggest possibility of underlying genetic abnormality, genetic testing is suggestedIndividuals with parafibromin-deficient parathyroid neoplasm should undergo CDC73 sequencing for germline mutation, which can occur de novo in individuals with no family historyMost parafibromin-deficient tumors have germline CDC73 mutation, but somatic inactivating CDC73 mutation, often in combination with loss of remaining allele or biallelic somatic only mutations, can occurSomatic biallelic CDC73 mutation occurs but uncommonAbsence of parafibromin loss does not rule out possibility of CDC73 mutationParafibromin nuclear expression may be preserved in HPT-JT as some point mutations in CDC73 may not be associated with loss of nuclear parafibromin expression, thus preserved nuclear parafibromin expression does not exclude CDC73 mutationSomatic CDC73 mutations often occur in sporadic parathyroid carcinomaParafibromin expression may have utility predicting outcome in atypical parathyroid tumorsParafibromin-positive atypical parathyroid tumors usually do not recurParafibromin-negative tumors may recur and may be considered tumors of low malignant potentialParafibromin immunostain helpful but requires rigorously controlled testingParathyroid carcinoma or

mutations are common in sporadic parathyroid carcinomas and rare in sporadic adenomas but can be seen in adenomas in HPT-JTComplete loss of parafibromin (CDC73) protein expression helpful in separating parathyroid carcinoma from adenoma and atypical parathyroid tumor; however, parafibromin expression may be lost in all parathyroid tumors associated with germline CDC73 mutationsParathyroid

FraumeniIntroductionLi-Fraumeni SyndromeIn 1969, Frederick Li and Joseph Fraumeni recognized unusual pattern of cancers in 4 families with autosomal dominant transmissionFamily members developed wide variety of different types of cancersSyndrome-related cancers developed at different ages at different frequency0-15 years: Sarcomas, adrenal cortical carcinomas, brain tumors, leukemia16-50 years: Sarcomas, breast carcinomas, brain tumors, leukemia> 50 years: Breast carcinomas, sarcomas, lung carcinomas, prostate carcinomasLFS was discovered to be due to pathogenic germline mutations in TP53, key tumor suppressor gene involved in maintenance of genomic stabilityAutosomal dominant inheritanceLFS is characterized by high phenotypic heterogeneity with wide spectrum of tumors developing at unusually young agesCumulative cancer risk ~ 50% by age 40, ~ 90% by age 60Broader genetic testing is identifying individuals with germline TP53 mutations without typical family historiesThese individuals generally have mutations of lower penetrance or lower pathogenicity or have de novo mutationsLi-Fraumeni-like syndrome has been used to refer to individuals who do not fulfill all clinical criteria for LFS20-40% have germline TP53 mutations and are classified as having LFSOther individuals may have germline mutations in genes such as BRCA2, Fanconi genes (BRIP1, PALB2, and RAD51C), and DNA mismatch repair genesEpidemiologyIncidence of TP53 Germline Mutations~ 1/5,000 to 1/20,000 individuals have pathogenic mutationsHowever, broader screening has identified germline mutations in up to 1/400-800 individualsMutations associated with cancers, but not associated with classic LFS history, show lower penetrance and cancers occur at older ageMutations not yet associated with cancer are of uncertain significanceModels being developed in order to help determine if newly detected mutation is likely to be pathogenicOne population in southeastern Brazil has 1/300 incidenceDue to specific mutation R337H (c.1010G > A, p.Arg337His)Lifetime risk for cancer: ~ 50-60%Adrenal cortical carcinoma is most common cancer to be diagnosed 1st in all age groupsAdults also develop breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma (STS), and choroid plexus carcinoma~ 12% of Brazilian women who present with breast cancer at < 45 years have this mutationIncidence Among Women With Breast CarcinomaTP53 germline mutations associated with ~ 6% of breast carcinomas in women < 31 years of ageResponsible for ~ 3% of all breast cancers due to germline mutationModifiers of RiskType of TP53 germline mutation alters age of onsetMissense mutationsDominant-negative missense mutations result in abnormal protein that interferes with function of normal proteinResults in defect in p53 from time of conception1st tumor has earlier age of onsetOccurs in majority of pediatric patientsOther missense mutations result in proteins that gain functions that promote tumorsLoss-of-function mutations (e.g., nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, genomic rearrangements) likely require 2nd event to alter p53 functionSomatic mutations in TP53 &/or inactivation of protein p53 are most common alterations detected in all cancers1st tumor in LFS has later age of onsetType of TP53 mutation alters penetranceDominant-negative missense mutations are more highly penetrant (more individuals develop tumors) than other types of mutationsChemotherapy and radiation therapy for 1st tumor likely contribute to subsequent cancersMultiple primary tumors occur in ~ 40% of LFS patients~ 1/3 of LFS patients develop 2nd tumors in radiation fieldsSexMedian age of developing 1st cancer is higher in females compared to males (28 years vs. 17 years) due to large number of breast cancersIf breast cancers are excluded, median age of 1st cancer in females is ~ 13 years vs. ~ 17 years for malesAfter age 20, incidence of breast cancer in females results in higher overall cancer rates compared to malesLifetime risk: ~ 100% for females, ~ 75% for malesOther modifying factorsGenomic changes, such as TP53 polymorphisms, p53 inhibitor MDM2 variants, miR-605 microRNA variants, and telomere length, may influence clinical characteristics (e.g., age of 1st tumor)GeneticsTP53Located on 17p13.120 kb, 11 coding exons, 393 amino acidsAutosomal dominant inheritanceMissense mutations: Majority of cases (~ 75%)Most are within central DNA binding domain: 85% in exons 5-8Alter DNA binding capacity or destabilize 3D structure of proteinAltered protein can have dominant-negative effect: Abnormal protein interferes with function of wildtype proteinOccurs in ~ 1/3 of affected LFS familiesAll cells have abnormal p53 function from birth without need for additional mutationsResults in earlier age of diagnosis of 1st tumorUnlike other germline tumor suppressor genes, 2/3 of tumors in individuals with missense mutations retain wildtype alleleRetention likely due to lower selective pressure to lose wildtype proteinNull mutations: Minority of casesMay be due to nonsense or splice site mutations, deletions, or insertionsResults in nonfunctional proteinLoss or inactivation of wildtype allele is necessary to alter normal TP53 functionLike other germline tumor suppressor genes, majority of tumors exhibit loss of wildtype alleleTP53 mutation database maintained by International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), updated each year> 1,500 germline mutations currently includedFunction of p53 ProteinTranscription factor with central role to upregulate genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA replication, DNA repair, apoptosis, and senescence, in response to DNA damageBinds to double-stranded DNATransactivation function for promoter sequencesActivated in response to various stress signalsProtects cells against genomic changes resulting from DNA damagep53 provides mechanism of protection against accumulation of genetic alterationsActivates DNA repair proteins when DNA has been damagedCell cycle arrest allows repair of genetic damage prior to DNA replication and fixation of mutationsTerminally damaged cells undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death)Central role of p53 as tumor suppressor has led to its title as \"guardian of genome\"Immunohistochemistry for p53p53 protein degrades rapidly with only 20-minute half-lifeSome mutant forms of p53 cannot transcriptionally activate MDM2Loss of this negative feedback loop results in p53 accumulationMany antibodies to p53 are availableTarget different epitopes on proteinMay detect only wildtype protein, mutant protein, or bothDifferent patterns of positivity observed in tumorsAbnormal pattern; complete absence: All cells negativeMay correlate with genomic alterations resulting in absence of p53 expression (e.g., deletions, nonsense, splice site mutations)Wildtype pattern: Mixture of negative cells and weak to strongly staining cellsMay correlate with presence of normal TP53However, some splice site mutations or truncating mutations can result in nonfunctional p53 that mimics normal patternSeen in normal tissuesMay be activated in response to inflammation or other stress signalsAbnormal pattern; overexpression: Diffuse strong positivity in majority of cellsOften correlates with mutations that stabilize protein (~ 96% of missense mutations)Some mutant forms of p53 have half-lives of up to 4 hoursImmunohistochemistry

however, it is unclear how mutations in this gene cause other features of CS, e.g., macrocephaly and intellectual disabilityOther LociIn some patients who lack PTEN mutations, hypermethylation of promoter of killin (KLLN), leading to reduced expression of KLLN, has been describedKLLN, which is located on chromosome 10q23 and functions as p53-regulated inhibitor of DNA synthesis, shares same transcription site as PTENOther patients have been reported with mutations in succinate dehydrogenase, mostly SDHB and SDHD subunitsGermline succinate dehydrogenase mutations have been found in ~ 5% of PTEN mutation-negative CS/CS-like individualsAssociated with increased frequencies of breast, thyroid, and renal cancers beyond those conferred by germline PTEN mutationTumor suppressor PTEN classically counteracts PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascadeGermline pathogenic PTEN mutations cause PHTSGermline and somatic mosaic mutations in genes encoding components of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway downstream of PTEN predispose to syndromes with partially overlapping clinical features, termed PTEN-opathiesGermline PIK3CA and AKT1 mutations have also been reported in phenotypic CS patients without PTEN, SDH, or KLLN mutations8% of CS/CS-like and BRRS so-called PTEN-wildtype patients;

and Care Excellence, and other organizations recommend testing individuals at high risk for having pathogenic mutation in BC predisposition geneNCCN version 2.2025 available at www.nccn.orgIn general, high risk is defined as > 10% likelihood of having mutationHowever, up to 50% of women with germline mutations (particularly in lower risk/lower penetrance genes) may not fulfill criteria for testingIn addition, some individuals may lack family history due to adoption, sperm donation, very small family size, or other reasonsCriteria based on cancer history to identify individuals at risk for high-penetrance BC genes generally include (but are not limited to)Personal history of BC at < 50 years of age, TNBC at < 60 years of age, multiple breast cancersTNBC at any ageMultiple primary BCs either synchronous or metachronous at any ageInvasive lobular BC with personal or family history of diffuse gastric carcinoma at any ageMale BC at any age≥ 1st-degree relative with known germline mutation, BC at ≤ 50 years of age, male BC, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, or prostate cancer with metastases or high-risk features≥ 3 diagnoses of BC &/or prostate cancer (any grade) on same side of family, including individual with BCFor family, most useful to begin testing individual with BCIf multiple affected individuals are present within kindred, testing can establish linkage between cancer(s) and mutationOnce mutation detected, other family members without cancer may choose testingCounseling should occur before testing to ensure patient is aware of possible implications for individual and familyHigh level of expertise and synergistic cooperation between genetics and medical oncology requiredClassification of resultsMutations are classified into 5 groupsBenign or likely benign: Both considered negative resultPathogenic or likely pathogenic: Both considered positive resultVariants of unknown significance (VUS): Should not be used for patient managementGenetic polymorphism that has not yet been associated with increased risk of cancerFound in 3-7% of individuals tested for BRCA1 and BRCA2> 1,500 identifiedMore frequent in minority ethnic populations underrepresented in genetic databasesMust be identified in multiple individuals to determine clinical significanceExtent of testingFull genome sequencing required to detect all mutationsMay become feasible in near futureDoes not detect all genetic alterationsLimited sequence analysis can be used to detect most likely mutationCommon mutations found in ethnic groups, e.g., 2 BRCA1 and 1 BRCA2

in noncoding regions may not be detected by standard sequence analysis18% of genetic changes in BRCA1 and BRCA2 not detected by standard testingAlso underlie pathogenic variants in other BC predisposition mutationsBRACAnalysis Large Rearrangement Test (BART) detects some rearrangementsAccount for 17% of deleterious mutations in individuals from Near East/Middle East and 22% of deleterious mutations in individuals from Latin America/CaribbeanSingle gene testingUseful when relative has known germline mutation, individual belongs to group with founder mutation of high frequency, or family history is highly suggestive of mutation in specific geneHowever, mutations in other genes may be missedOf all individuals meeting recommended criteria for testing for BRCA1/BRCA2, ~ 10% will be found to have germline mutationHowever, in only ~ 1/3 will mutation be in BRCA1/BRCA2In addition, ~ 6% of individuals with BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutation do not meet criteria for testing for these genesTherefore, multigene testing is required to detect majority of germline mutationsMultigene panel testingCurrently most common method of testingCompanies offer different sets of panels and extent of testingCan offer results on ≥ 5-50 genesMay or may not offer evaluation of deletions and duplicationsIncreases number of VUS detectedDetection of VUS augments complexity of patient managementDirect to consumer testingTypically only includes most common mutationsIf negative result obtained and strong likelihood of germline mutation due to personal or family history, more comprehensive testing by certified laboratory should be pursuedIf positive result is obtained, result should be confirmed by certified laboratoryIn one study, 40% of positive results obtained by direct to consumer testing could not be confirmed by certified laboratoryPolygenic risk scores (PRS)Common (> 1% incidence) single nucleotide polymorphisms can slightly increase risk of BC> 170 genes with mutations conferring low risk of BC have been identifiedAlthough of little significance alone, multiple polymorphisms can be combined into PRS to modify risk estimates for individuals ± germline mutationsIn combination, these low-risk genes may account for ~ 18% of familial risk of BCMedical Care of Individuals With Germline MutationsOverviewLongstanding approach for risk mitigation in

self-breast awareness with periodic breast examinationsMammography at earlier age (10 years before age at which youngest relative with BC was diagnosed) or more frequentlyMR screening is more sensitive than mammography in young women with dense breastsHowever, lower specificity leads to greater numbers of biopsies for benign lesionsScreening by mammography and MR may be staggered every 6 months to decrease screening intervalProphylactic surgeryBilateral mastectomy reduces risk of BC by 97%Not all breast tissue can be removed in all patients with acceptable cosmetic resultsMajor benefit is to women prior to development of BC; limited or no benefit after BC diagnosis with possible distant metastasesBilateral salpingo-oophorectomy reduces risk of ovarian and fallopian tube

be linked to prostate, lung, colon, kidney, and thyroid cancers, lymphoma, and sarcoma, but degree of risk is unclearREPORTINGGenetic TestingPopulation to be testedNational Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), U.\nS.\nPreventative Services Task Force, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, and other organizations recommend testing individuals at high risk for having pathogenic mutation in BC predisposition geneNCCN version 2.2025 available at www.nccn.orgIn general, high risk is defined as > 10% likelihood of having mutationHowever, up to 50% of women with germline mutations (particularly in lower risk/lower penetrance genes) may not fulfill criteria for testingIn addition, some individuals may lack family history due to adoption, sperm donation, very small family size, or other reasonsCriteria based on cancer history to identify individuals at risk for high-penetrance BC genes generally include (but are not limited to)Personal history of BC at < 50 years of age, TNBC at < 60 years of age, multiple breast cancersTNBC at any ageMultiple primary BCs either synchronous or metachronous at any ageInvasive lobular BC with personal or family history of diffuse gastric carcinoma at any ageMale BC at any age≥ 1st-degree relative with known germline mutation, BC at ≤ 50 years of age, male BC, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, or prostate cancer with metastases or high-risk features≥ 3 diagnoses of BC &/or prostate cancer (any grade) on same side of family, including individual with BCFor family, most useful to begin testing individual with BCIf multiple affected individuals are present within kindred, testing can establish linkage between cancer(s) and mutationOnce mutation detected, other family members without cancer may choose testingCounseling should occur before testing to ensure patient is aware of possible implications for individual and familyHigh level of expertise and synergistic cooperation between genetics and medical oncology requiredClassification of resultsMutations are classified into 5 groupsBenign or likely benign: Both considered negative resultPathogenic or likely pathogenic: Both considered positive resultVariants of unknown significance (VUS): Should not be used for patient managementGenetic polymorphism that has not yet been associated with increased risk of cancerFound in 3-7% of individuals tested for BRCA1 and BRCA2> 1,500 identifiedMore frequent in minority ethnic populations underrepresented in genetic databasesMust be identified in multiple individuals to determine clinical significanceExtent of testingFull genome sequencing required to detect all mutationsMay become feasible in near futureDoes not detect all genetic alterationsLimited sequence analysis can be used to detect most likely mutationCommon mutations found in ethnic groups, e.g., 2 BRCA1 and 1 BRCA2 mutations comprise 90% of mutations found in Ashkenazi Jewish populationHotspots for mutations within geneDetection of known mutation in familyDuplications, inversions, large deletions, and mutations in noncoding regions may not be detected by standard sequence analysis18% of genetic changes in BRCA1 and BRCA2 not detected by standard testingAlso underlie pathogenic variants in other BC predisposition mutationsBRACAnalysis Large Rearrangement Test (BART) detects some rearrangementsAccount for 17% of deleterious mutations in individuals from Near East/Middle East and 22% of deleterious mutations in individuals from Latin America/CaribbeanSingle gene testingUseful when relative has known germline mutation, individual belongs to group with founder mutation of high frequency, or family history is highly suggestive of mutation in specific geneHowever, mutations in other genes may be missedOf all individuals meeting recommended criteria for testing for BRCA1/BRCA2, ~ 10% will be found to have germline mutationHowever, in only ~ 1/3 will mutation be in BRCA1/BRCA2In addition, ~ 6% of individuals with BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutation do not meet criteria for testing for these genesTherefore, multigene testing is required to detect majority of germline mutationsMultigene panel testingCurrently most common method of testingCompanies offer different sets of panels and extent of testingCan offer results on ≥ 5-50 genesMay or may not offer evaluation of deletions and duplicationsIncreases number of VUS detectedDetection of VUS augments complexity of patient managementDirect to consumer testingTypically only includes most common mutationsIf negative result obtained and strong likelihood of germline mutation due to personal or family history, more comprehensive testing by certified laboratory should be pursuedIf positive result is obtained, result should be confirmed by certified laboratoryIn one study, 40% of positive results obtained by direct to consumer testing could not be confirmed by certified laboratoryPolygenic risk scores (PRS)Common (> 1% incidence) single nucleotide polymorphisms can slightly increase risk of BC> 170 genes with mutations conferring low risk of BC have been identifiedAlthough of little significance alone, multiple polymorphisms can be combined into PRS to modify risk estimates for individuals ± germline mutationsIn combination, these low-risk genes may account for ~ 18% of familial risk of BCMedical Care of Individuals With Germline MutationsOverviewLongstanding approach for risk mitigation in affected individuals has centered around primary and secondary prevention strategiesIdentification of pathogenic germline mutation may modify medical care in multiple areasNotification of relatives at possible riskChemopreventionProphylactic surgeryScreeningAlterations in cancer therapy targeted to mutation for patients with BCAssisted reproduction to avoid passing mutation to next generationBenefit of interventions is greatest for individuals with high-risk mutations and less certain for those with moderate-risk mutationsChemopreventionTamoxifen reduces risk of ER (+) BC for women with family history of BCHowever, risk of endometrial cancer and thrombosis increasedBenefit of chemoprevention for primary prevention of BC for individuals with germline mutations is not yet clear\nTreatment with tamoxifen for 1st BC reduces risk of 2nd contralateral BC by ~ 44% in BRCA1/BRCA2 carriersScreeningClinical breast examination 2x yearly starting at 25 years of agePatient self-breast awareness with periodic breast examinationsMammography at earlier age (10 years before age at which youngest relative with BC was diagnosed) or more frequentlyMR screening is more sensitive than mammography in young women with dense breastsHowever, lower specificity leads to greater numbers of biopsies for benign lesionsScreening by mammography and MR may be staggered every 6 months to decrease screening intervalProphylactic surgeryBilateral mastectomy reduces risk of BC by 97%Not all breast tissue can be removed in all patients with acceptable cosmetic resultsMajor benefit is to women prior to development of BC; limited or no benefit after BC diagnosis with possible distant metastasesBilateral salpingo-oophorectomy reduces risk of ovarian and fallopian tube cancer by 70-95%Relevant for mutations that increase risk of both breast and ovarian cancerScreening for ovarian cancer has remained elusive, leading to focus on primary preventionWomen remain at risk for primary peritoneal cancersReduces risk of BC by 50% in premenopausal women, presumably due to decrease in hormone productionReduces risk of ER (-) BC for BRCA1 patients to lesser degree; mechanism is unknownInterval salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy undergoing study as risk-reducing approach in high-risk womenMay help improve menopause-related quality of life, while mitigating riskProphylactic radiation to reduce contralateral BC riskContralateral risk is ~ 40% for those with BRCA1 and 26% for those with BRCA2 mutationsPhase II trial has suggested that prophylactic contralateral irradiation can significantly reduce risk of contralateral BCsLong-term follow-up is ongoingAlterations in recommendations for systemic therapyFor patients with advanced BC, presence of germline mutation may alter type of therapyBRCA1/BRCA2: Platinum-based chemotherapy and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (olaparib or talazoparib)BRCA1/BRCA2-associated TNBC: CarboplatinChildbearingAssisted reproduction can be used to prevent germline mutation being passed on to children"

relatively high penetrance, but there are also several autosomal recessive conditionsTumors typically develop at younger age compared to sporadic counterpartsMultiple primary tumors can arise in affected organEnvironmental factors can modulate extent of cancer riskNew susceptibility genes continue to be identified, and many of these are lower penetranceGermline genetic testing standard of care for establishing diagnosis of most hereditary cancer syndromesBackground~ 10% of all cancers are attributable to inherited cancer predisposition geneIdentifying clinical features suggesting possibility of genetic predisposition to cancer is 1st step to diagnosing these syndromesStudies of rare familial clusters have been remarkably productive scientific and clinical approach providing 1st clues about genetics of these syndromesIdentification of 1st cancer susceptibility genes (i.e., RB1, APC)Molecular pathogenesis of hereditary tumors informed understanding of more common sporadic counterpartsFull spectrum of clinical phenotypes and specific genotype-phenotype correlations were definedSingle-gene hereditary syndromes account for only small fraction of familial clustering on population basisGenetics of many \"familial\" cases remain undefinedPathologists can often play important role in recognizing hereditary cancer syndromesImmunohistochemistry for DNA mismatch repair proteins can raise suspicion for Lynch syndromeCumulative colon adenoma count over time can raise suspicion for polyposis syndromeRecognizing hereditary cancer syndromes has several key clinical implicationsManagement of cancer may changeAltered surgical approach (i.e., more extensive colonic resection for colon cancer in Lynch syndrome)Selection of chemotherapy regimen (i.e., use of PARP-inhibitor in BRCA mutation-positive tumor)Cancer screening may be more intensive (higher frequency) and extensive (inclusion of multiple other organ systems)Risk-reducing operations may be option for individuals at high risk for certain cancersFamily members also at risk for these hereditary syndromes and should undergo counselingIdentification of At-Risk IndividualsAccurate identification of patients at increased risk for developing cancer is essentialObtaining careful family history of cancer is key 1st step and should be routine part of clinical practice2-generation pedigree should be obtained as minimum; 3 generations idealNow routine to pursue cancer genetics risk assessment, which includes option of germline mutation testing for relevant genesIdentification of individuals at risk for cancer has become integral part of medicineWill allow health care providers to intervene with appropriate clinical managementCounseling and educationIncreased cancer surveillanceCancer preventionGenetic risk assessment in context of childhood cancer is specific circumstance and requires participation of all family membersNational Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has established criteria for those individuals who should undergo further genetic risk assessmentMultiple algorithmic approach for tumor syndromes available onlinehttp://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/genetics_screeningGenetic testing should be offered to all patients with specific cancersNCCN currently recommends genetic testing for all patients with ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancerSuch \"universal\" approaches reduce burden of remembering clinical criteria for genetics referralThere is growing interest in germline genetic testing for all patients with any solid tumorCancer Susceptibility TestingASCO: Indications for TestingAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommends that genetic testing be offered whenIndividual has personal or family history features suggestive of genetic cancer susceptibility conditionTests can be adequately interpretedResults will aid in diagnosis or influence medical or surgical management of patient or family members at hereditary risk of cancerASCO recommends that genetic testing only be done in setting of pre- and posttest counseling, which should include discussion of possible risks and benefits of early cancer detection and prevention modalitiesASCO: Policy StatementAdvent of syndrome-specific germline mutation testing represents major advance in care of cancer-prone individualsASCO reaffirms its commitment to integrating cancer risk assessment and management, including molecular analysis of cancer predisposition genes, into practice of oncology and preventive medicineGenetic testing for cancer susceptibility has become accepted part of oncologic careGermline testing for inherited predisposition is well established as part of care of individuals who may be at hereditary risk for cancers of breast, ovary, colon, stomach, uterus, thyroid, and other primary sitesGermline genetic testing is distinct from somatic genetic profiling of cancer tissue to predict prognosis or treatment responseGermline testing involves analysis of DNA from blood or saliva for inherited mutations in specific genes that are associated with type of cancer seen in individual or family seeking assessmentWhen identified, such high-penetrance mutations usually result in significant alteration in function of corresponding gene product and are associated with large increases in cancer riskOther mutations result in less dramatic increases in risk (intermediate penetrance)Identification of high-penetrance mutation often justifies adjustment of clinical care through modification of surveillance or through preventive surgeryGermline testing for certain high-penetrance predispositions is now part of clinical guidelines and is reimbursed by most 3rd-party payersImpact of low- and moderate-penetrance mutations on clinical care is less clearASCO: Clinical Utility of Genetic TestingGenetic tests may benefit individuals by providing deeper self-knowledge and motivation to pursue healthy behaviors, even if results do not inform clinical decision makingTests for high-penetrance mutations in appropriate populations have clinical utility, meaning that they inform clinical decision making and facilitate prevention or amelioration of adverse health outcomesGenetic tests for intermediate-penetrance mutations and genomic profiles of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to low-penetrance variants are of uncertain clinical utilityASCO: Informed ConsentProposed elements of informed consent related to testing for inherited cancer susceptibility are set forthBasic elements of informed consent for cancer susceptibility testingInformation on specific genetic mutation(s) or genomic variant(s) being tested, including whether range of risk associated with variant will impact medical careImplications of positive and negative resultPossibility that test will not be informativeOptions for risk estimation without genetic or genomic

limitations of medical surveillance and strategies for prevention after genetic or genomic testingImportance of sharing genetic and genomic test results with at-risk relatives so that they may benefit from this informationPlans for follow-up after testingSpecial Issues Related to Genetic Testing ResearchProspective clinical trials, large registries, and retrospective reviews are most accurate methods forDeriving relative risks of genetic variantsMeasuring response to and effectiveness of clinical interventions based on genetic cancer risk assessmentTests with uncertain clinical utility have become commercially availableCrucial to establish evidence-based algorithm for clinically responsible use of these testsWherever possible, genetic tests with uncertain clinical utility should be administered in context of clinical trialsResearch should include basic studies of functional significance of genetic variants linked to disease risk as well as prospective, randomized controlled trials of individual genomic markersAt translational level, important to establish criteria for technologic assessment of genetic and other diagnostic testsResearch should focus on extent to which personal benefits accrue to individuals who receive tests that have uncertain clinical utilityEstablishing evidence-based test for personal utility is particularly important for tests that would not be recommended based on clinical utilityResearch is also needed to demonstrate validity and reproducibility of some commercially available testsBecause algorithms used to convert genotypes into absolute risk estimates are empirically derived, prospective research is needed to confirm calibration of these estimates and to measure effectiveness of interventions based on individual genomic profilingIf genetic and genomic tests for cancer risk are going to be offered or justified on basis of personal utility, effort should be made to establish evidence-based tests for these claimsGenetic CounselingGenetic testing should be conducted only in setting of pre- and posttest counselingPretest counselingAllows for advance consideration of possible test results, medical options, and impact test results may have on family membersPermits discussion of pros/cons of which genetic test to orderSingle gene analysisAnalysis of several genes associated with specific syndromeAnalysis of panel of genes associated with specific tumor typeAnalysis of comprehensive panel of genes associated with multiple tumor typesPosttest counselingProvides valuable opportunity for health care providers to

continueUnderstanding molecular pathogenesis may hopefully offer new insights into diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for these tumorsNew hereditary syndromes continue to be identifiedRecently, germline mutations of DICER1 have been identified in patients with rare neoplasmsDICER1 mutations identified in patients with familial pleuropulmonary blastomaAdditional manifestations of syndrome have been identified, including cystic nephroma, thyroid carcinoma, medulloepithelioma, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, pituitary blastoma, and othersFamilial pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCC/PGL) syndromes form heterogeneous group of tumorsExtensive genetic heterogeneity of these tumors came to light with identification of multiple susceptibility genesAt least 13 PPC/PGL syndromes are hereditaryMutations account for at least 30% of these tumors, highest inheritable proportion of any known human tumorRecognizing presence of hereditary syndrome is critical for proper patient managementUniversal testing strategies may become more common in futureHereditary cancer syndromes in children and adolescents are also recognized in field of pediatric hematology/oncologyNow number of online resources available that provide more comprehensive information about these conditionsGeneTests: Resource for those seeing individuals with genetic disordershttp://www. genetests.orgPathologists can play crucial role; important for surgical pathologists to be aware of specific pathology findings suggesting possible tumor syndrome",

        "raw_text": "OVERVIEW OF HEREDITARY CANCERHereditary~ 90% of cancer in adults is sporadic and attributed to unrepaired damage to genome caused by environmental exposures, diet, aging, or other influences~ 10% of cancer develops in setting of hereditary predisposition and is largely caused by inherited genetic variant in genes that predispose to familial cancer syndromes> 50 Mendelian hereditary cancer syndromes with very high risk of cancer> 100 Mendelian hereditary cancer syndromes with predisposition to cancerAdvancements in genetic testing and population-based studies suggest this proportion is increasingProportion of cancer cases with hereditary background is steadily increasingFamilial refers to occurrence of cancer (i.e., phenotype) with greater frequencies in families than in general population\"Familial\" and \"hereditary\" are frequently used synonymouslyAdvancements in polygenic risk scores (PRS) provide nuanced risk stratification for individuals with low-penetrance variantsPRS tools integrate multiple genetic variants, offering more personalized risk assessment, especially for breast and prostate cancersOccurrence patterns that raise likelihood of familial cancer syndromeMany cases of same type of cancerCancer occurring at younger age than usual> 1 type of cancer in single personCancer occurring in both pairs of organ (e.g., both breasts; bilateral distribution)> 1 childhood cancer in siblingsCancer occurring in sex not usually affected (e.g., breast cancer in men)Cancer occurring in many generationsGermline mutation is another way to refer to inherited mutation because these mutations occur in specialized tissues that give rise to germ/sex cells (i.e., sperm or oocytes) and can be transmitted to next generationFamily HistoryCan help identify individuals at risk for developing cancer1st-degree relatives include individual's parents, children, and brothers and sisters, including half-brothers and half-sisters2nd-degree relatives include grandparents, aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews, and grandchildren3rd-degree relatives include first cousins, great grandparents, great aunts and uncles, and great grandchildrenEmerging Syndromes and Expanded IndicationsNew familial cancer syndromes continue to be identified and refined3 classes of mesenchymal tumors with DICER1 alterations have been termed LGMT DICER1, SARC DICER1, and PIS DICER1 based on methylation data enabling meaningful treatment optionsGermline CDH1 mutations are found in lobular breast cancer (LBC) not associated with classical hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome leading to criteria for screening and managing high-risk patientsGENETICS OF FAMILIAL CANCERGermline vs. Somatic VariantsMost germline variants are present in 100% of cells, including both nonmalignant and tumor cells leading to allelic fractions of 0.5 or 1.0 in both tissue componentsMosaicism in genes, such as TP53, has emerged as important consideration for atypical presentations of Li-Fraumeni syndromeSomatic variants are acquired after birth and result from either errors in DNA repair or replication, and allelic fractions in tumors are usually < 0.5 due to presence of nonmalignant tissue within tumorAllelic fractions > 0.5 may indicate loss of heterozygosity, such as deletion of complementary alleleFamilial cancer syndromes often present and 1st come to clinical attention as primary tumor in some familiesIn these instances, genetic analysis of tumor often identifies several pathogenic variants, including variants in known familial cancer syndrome genes (e.g., BRCA1 or TP53)Laboratories must correctly distinguish somatic variants from germline variants in cancer patients due to serious clinical consequences for patientPaired normal-tumor sequencing increasingly utilized to determine if variant is germlineClinical features can also be used to help determine whether origin of variants is germline or somaticAlleleHumans have 2 copies of each genes at same locus because we inherit 1 copy from each parentEach copy differs in sequence &/or structure and are considered variants of each otherAllele is used to distinguish variant forms of gene, and, accordingly, individuals inherit 2 alleles of each geneConsequently, men have only 1 copy (and therefore 1 allele) of genes on their X and Y chromosomesAlleles of same gene may be fully functional, completely defective, or functional at some level between these extremesVariant\"Variant\" should be used in place of mutation and polymorphism\"Mutation\" and \"polymorphism\" often lead to confusion because of incorrect assumptions of pathogenic and benign effects, respectivelyMutation is permanent change in nucleotide sequencePolymorphism is variant with frequency > 1% in populationTools like ClinVarMiner streamline classification and reclassification of variantsInheritance PatternsAutosomal dominance (AD) inheritance occurs when pathogenic variant is present in 1 copy of familial cancer-associated gene (i.e., individual is heterozygous for pathogenic variant)In AD diseases, risk is increased when 1 pathogenic allele is inheritedAutosomal recessive (AR) inheritance occurs when pathogenic variant is present in both copies of gene (i.e., individual is homozygous for pathogenic variant)Pathogenic variant present in each gene is not necessarily same variant, and this situation is referred to as compound heterozygosityIn AR disease, 2 pathogenic alleles must be inherited for increased risk of diseaseLoss of HeterozygosityRepresents \"2nd hit\" of remaining functional allele in patients who inherited defective familial cancer geneOccurs by interstitial deletion, mitotic recombination, or nondisjunction of remaining functional allele leading its deletion &/or functional inactivationRepresents most common mechanism by which remaining functional allele is disruptedAlternative mechanisms include somatic mutation or epigenetic alteration of functional allele as 2nd hitTumor suppressor genes are frequently inactivated in familial cancer syndromesGENETIC VARIANTSSimple VariantsOne

hereditary originMajority of these diseases are inherited in autosomal dominant fashionAwareness of important manifestations associated with each syndrome that might provide additional clues to hereditary/familial neoplasia syndrome is importantRecognizing and identifying hereditary diseases during routine medical practice is neededHereditary Syndromes: Practical Guide to Pathological RecognitionSignificant proportion of hereditary neoplasia displays distinct/unusual histopathological &/or immunophenotypic features that make pathologists 1st medical specialists to recognize their inherited natureRole of pathologist resides in suspecting/recognizing inherited tumors and alerting clinicians to possibility of inherited predispositionAll patients identified as having familial tumors should be screened for mutation associated with familial diseaseGeneticists and clinicians should perform additional clinical and genetic evaluation for confirmationIt is becoming increasingly well recognized that given familial tumor syndrome may be very heterogeneous in clinical appearanceAs molecular diagnostic testing for these familial diseases has become more readily available, heterogeneous clinical appearance seen in many syndromes has become better recognizedDiverse neoplasias are common finding in patients with genetic predisposition to cancerPatients without overt clinical signs of underlying syndrome may present initially for treatment of tumorIdentification of hereditary cases and early diagnosis makes preventive surgery and adequate treatment possibleMost patients with familial disease are asymptomatic and discovered through genetic screening in predisposing familiesVast majority of tumors occurring in familial setting are multiple, bilateral, and involve multiple organsRecognition of Morphological Characteristics Indicating Familial Tumor SyndromesAwareness of pathologic features of neoplasms seen in variety of hereditary/familial neoplasia

hamartomatous lesionsSpecific location of tumorUnique morphological features of tumorPresence of precursor lesionsMany surgical specimens received from patients who have known syndrome diagnosis at time of surgeryPathologist may be 1st physician to suggest possibility of syndromic association based on presence of unique pathologic findings in tumor resection specimenGross and histological features that are evaluated in routine tumor resection specimens might suggest each individual syndromeIn their pathological examinations, it is important for surgical pathologists to be aware of specific gross and microscopic findings that suggest possible syndromic associationSome tumors frequently display characteristic clinical, biochemical, and histopathological features that, although not pathognomonic, can be helpful in suggesting inherited disease as underlying etiology and distinguishing these tumors from sporadic casesCharacteristic and distinct pathologic findings should alert pathologists to possible familial cancer syndromeCorrect histologic interpretation may lead to further molecular genetic evaluation of patient and family membersPathology ReportingIf constellation of pathologic findings strongly suggests potential syndromic associationConsult medical records for diagnosis of potential syndromePathologists should notify clinicians about this possibility, consider

carcinoma; majority are thought to arise from fimbriated end of fallopian tubeBoth cancers share similarities in gene expression and mutation profiles (e.g., frequent TP53 mutations, MYC amplification and overexpression, and RB1 loss)Very specific increased risk for these 2 types of cancer is not completely understoodOne proposal is that higher estrogen levels due to diminished BRCA1 protein (which is negative regulator of estrogen) stimulates growth of progenitor cellsER-negative progenitor cells in breast may have their growth stimulated due to paracrine effects on other ER-positive epithelial cellsOther possibilities are under investigationEpidemiologyPopulation Incidence~ 1 in 300 (~ 0.1-0.3%)BRCA2 mutations found in ~ 0.1-0.7%Founder mutations present at increased frequency in specific

BRCA1 protein are availableDetected as nuclear immunoreactivityCarcinomas arising in women with BRCA1 germline mutations are positive or negative for nuclear BRCA1 in approximately equal proportionsSporadic breast cancers can also be positive or negative for BRCA1 proteinTherefore, immunohistochemical studies are not helpful to detect possible germline mutationsAbsence of BRCA1 protein in hereditary and sporadic breast cancers has been reported to be poor prognostic factorAssociated NeoplasmsFemale Breast CancerRisk (penetrance)40-90% of women with germline mutation will develop breast cancer by age 70Varies by mutationAfter diagnosis of 1st cancer, 40% of women develop contralateral cancer within 20 yearsPrognosisSome studies have shown lower survival compared to sporadic carcinomas, but this has not been supported by all studiesPrognosis may be related to higher sensitivity to drugs that cause DNA damage (platinum agents)BRCA1-associated TNBC is more likely to undergo pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (~ 46%) compared to TNBC not associated with BRCA1 (~ 27%)Patients who achieved pCR had improved survival compared to patients who did notPrecursor lesionsDefinite precursor lesion has not been identifiedProposed (but not proven) possible precursors includeHistologically normal cells with uniform p53 expression (analogous to \"p53 signature\" associated with fallopian tube serous carcinomas)Histologically normal cells associated with T-cell lymphocytic infiltrate (T-cell lymphocytic lobulitis)RANK-positive cells susceptible to DNA damageMicroglandular adenosis; however, this is more advanced lesion that lacks myoepithelial cells and has infiltrative patternDuctal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)BRCA1-associated DCIS is usually negative for ER, PR, and HER2 and has high nuclear gradeThis type of DCIS is rarely seen in absence of invasive carcinomaCells may fill acini in clinging pattern without distorting lobules, making DCIS difficult to recognizeDense lymphocytic infiltrate often surrounds involved lobulesMay be detected as enhancement seen on screening MR for high-risk patientsInvasive carcinoma: Histologic featuresTypically well-demarcated, pushing circumscribed bordersCan mimic benign lesions on imagingPredominantly poorly differentiatedHigh nuclear grade, high proliferation, foci of geographic tumor necrosis, &/or central fibrotic centerLymphocytic infiltrate commonMany BRCA1-associated cancers are associated with dense lymphocytic infiltrateLymphocytes are predominantly T cellsLymphocytic infiltrate is associated with better response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and improved survivalPrimary carcinoma can be mistaken for lymph node metastasis microscopically when there is dense lymphocytic infiltrateIdentification of normal breast tissue or DCIS within carcinoma excludes metastasisLymph node metastasis can be determined with confidence when there is definite lymph node capsuleCombination of circumscribed border, syncytial growth pattern (sheets of tumor cells at least 7 cells across), and lymphocytic infiltrates are components of \"medullary features\"60% of BRCA1-associated cancers have medullary features (13% fulfill prior criteria for medullary carcinoma)In one study, 3 of 18 TNBCs with medullary features were found to have BRCA1 mutations, all thought to be germline mutationsInvasive carcinoma: Biologic typeER-negative/HER2-negative TNBC: 70-80%Majority of these carcinomas group with basal-like carcinomas by gene expression profiling (mRNA)~ 7% (if > 60 years of age) to 30% (if < 30 years of age) of women with TNBC have BRCA1 germline mutations~ 1-17% of women with TNBC have BRCA2 germline mutationsSomatic BRCA1 mutations are only detected in ~

(SET) patterns compared to sporadic carcinomasBetter prognosis compared to sporadic carcinomas in first 10 yearsMay be due to greater response to therapyPlatinum-based therapy causing purine base cross-links that cells lacking BRCA1 cannot repair accuratelyPoly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors block alternative repair pathway, making cells more susceptible to DNA damageOther CancersProstate: Possibly increased but lower than for BRCA2Pancreas: Possibly increased but lower than for BRCA2Screening for BRCA1Population to Be TestedRecommendations for persons to be tested have broadened due to importance of identifying germline mutationsAffected individuals can take steps to reduce risk of subsequent cancers or to detect them at early stageCarcinomas associated with BRCA1 mutations are being treated with specific therapiesFamily members may also be at riskAffected individuals can choose to not pass mutation to their offspring with assisted reproductionCriteria have been developed to identify individuals with increased likelihood of germline mutation using following informationPersonal history of cancer, age at diagnosis, number of cancers, member of group with known increased incidence (e.g., Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry)Family history of cancer, age at diagnosis, number of cancers, identified germline mutationsPathologic features of cancers (type, presence of BRCA1 mutation)Weighted scoring systems are available to determine risk, including BRCAPRO, Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA), and Manchester Scoring SystemBRCAPRO available at http://www4.utsouthwestern.edu/breasthealth/cagene/BOADICEA available at http://astor.som.jhmi.edu/BayesMendel/brcapro.htmlAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and others have issued recommendations for testingGenetic TestingMultigene panel testing has become more common than testing for single genesFor women meeting NCCN guidelines for testing for BRCA1/BRCA2, ~ 10% will be found to have germline mutationHowever, only ~ 1/3 of tested individuals will have mutation in BRCA1/BRCA2; remainder have mutations in other genesIn addition, ~ 6% of individuals with BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutations do not meet criteria for testingThus, multigene testing can be helpful to detect major germline mutations conferring increased risk for breast cancerComprehensive testing by certified lab is necessary to detect all current gene variants known to increase cancer riskFull sequencing is required to detect all mutationsAdditional testing required to detect deletions and amplificationsDirect to consumer testing (not comprehensive)Assays for cancer risk marketed directly to individuals are generally not comprehensiveTypically only include most common mutations (e.g., 3 BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations common in Ashkenazi Jewish populations)In one study, 40% of results from direct to consumer testing could not be validated by certified laboratoryInterpretation of ResultsAlterations in BRCA1 may be variant with no increased risk, variant that greatly increases risk, or significance may currently be unknownIdeally, testing includes both pre- and posttest genetic counseling to help determine best type of testing and interpret resultsPathogenic variants (true positive)Some mutations are well documented to increase cancer risk in multiple members in affected familiesHelpful to test multiple members of families with newly detected variant in order to establish linkageNonpathogenic variants (true negative)Results show normal sequence or benign polymorphismThese include point mutations that do not alter type of amino acidVariants of uncertain significance (VUS) (inconclusive)Some alterations have not yet been linked to individuals with breast or ovarian cancerDetected in 7% of individuals tested (> 1,500 identified)More frequent in populations of non-European origin, as fewer individuals have been studiedVUS is problematic for individuals without personal or family history of cancer because linkage cannot be determinedMedical Care of Individuals With BRCA1 Germline MutationsOverviewIdentification of BRCA1 germline mutation can have important implications for medical careNotification of relatives at possible risk, childbearing, chemoprevention, screening systemic therapy, and prophylactic surgeryChemopreventionOral contraceptivesReduce risk of ovarian cancer by 50%Breast cancer risk may be increased by some types of oral contraceptives (results of studies have not been consistent)TamoxifenReduces riskEvidence derives from observed 50% reduction in risk of contralateral cancer among mutation carriers treated with tamoxifenProtective effect observed in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriersBRCA1 carriers appear to benefit despite predilection to develop ER-negative tumor for reasons that remain unclearBreast ScreeningAnnual mammograms, MR imaging, and clinical breast examination are recommendedHowever, for women with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations undergoing regular screening, 15% of malignancies can be interval cancers (cancers detected as palpable mass between screens)Compared to screen-detected cancers, interval cancers are larger, present at higher stage, and are more likely to be associated with positive lymph nodesMammography and MR may alternate every 6 months in order to reduce length of interval between screeningProphylactic SurgeryBilateral mastectomy reduces breast cancer risk by 97%However, not all breast tissue can be removed and achieve acceptable cosmetic resultsGreatest benefit for patients before diagnosis of cancerAfter cancer has been diagnosed, there may be no benefit if distant metastases are presentClinically and radiologically occult carcinoma is found in 1-15% of patientsCancers are most often DCIS or small invasive carcinomas with negative lymph nodesBilateral salpingo-oophorectomy reduces breast and ovarian cancer riskBreast cancer risk reduced by 50%Mechanism not well understood but may be due to decreased estrogen productionOvarian and fallopian tube cancer risk reduced by 50-96%4-5% risk of

diagnosisEndoscopic evaluation of upper GI tract at 20 years of ageRemove adenomas > 1 cm or with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) rather than eradicate all neoplasiaProgression rate to carcinoma in small bowel is lowAFAP: Close endoscopic surveillance, upper/lower GIComplete colonoscopy (common right-sided lesions)Surgical approachesProphylactic colectomy by age 20-25 years of ageIn mutation-positive patients with adenomasOperation: Colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis, orProctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosisContraindications: Mesenteric desmoids, advanced low rectal cancer, poor anal sphincter functionScreening of rectal stump/ileal pouch after surgeryDrugs: NSAIDs (sulindac) and selective COX-2 inhibitorsReduce rectal adenomas after subtotal colectomyDo not completely prevent

(PTH)DefinitionsFIHP is defined as hereditary primary hyperparathyroidism without association of other diseases or tumorsWithout characteristic extraparathyroidal features of more complex hyperparathyroid syndromeFIHP characterized by overactivity of parathyroid glands≥ 1 overactive parathyroid gland(s) release excess PTH, which causes hypercalcemiaLatest concepts of FIHP focus upon kindreds without mutation of either MEN1, CASR, or CDC7315-20% have germline-activating mutation of gene for GCM2 transcription factorHistorically, genetically heterogeneous and associated with mutations in different genes: MEN1, CDC73, CASR, and recently GCM2With increasing follow-up, many individuals thought to have familial isolated hyperparathyroidism developed extraparathyroid syndrome or featuresPTH stimulates removal of calcium from bone and absorption of calcium from dietParathyroid glands produce excess PTHFIHP is mainly due to 4-gland parathyroid disease or single-gland adenomaEpidemiologyAge RangeChildhood to adulthoodSexF ~ MIncidence~ 90% of hyperparathyroidism cases are sporadic~ 10% of hyperparathyroidism cases are familialFIHP accounts for 1% of PHPTRemainder of cases are associated with MEN1, MEN2, MEN4, hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome (HPT-JT), and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH)GeneticsAutosomal DominantGCM2 germline-activating mutationsGene required for parathyroid development and likely protooncogeneGCM2-associated FIHP may be associated with higher preoperative PTH levels, higher rate of multiglandular disease, decreased rate of biochemical cure, and risk of parathyroid carcinomaGermline missense GCM2 variants occur in general population but are significantly overrepresented in individuals with PHPT with multiglandular or familial parathyroid disease compared to general populationPenetrance of GCM2 variants is low, thus most individuals in general population with GCM2 variants will not develop hyperparathyroidismFrequency of GCM2 germline mutation is 17% among FIHP probands without mutation of MEN1, CASR, or CDC73Mutations in parafibromin gene CDC73 (chromosome 1q25) in small proportion of FIHP-like casesFIHP-like phenotypes have been associated with mutant MEN1 and CASR genotypesGenomic screen of 7 familial hyperparathyroidism families has identified suggestive 1.7 Mb region on chromosome 2For majority of cases (83% of FIHP probands without MEN, CASR, or CDC73 mutation), genetic cause is unknownDiagnosis of FIHP should be made after excluding mutations associated with other hereditary PHPT, such as MEN1, MEN2, MEN3, HPT-JT, and FHHFew cases per kindred are identified, possibly due to low penetrance of disease, or more likely lack of screening in small families with FIHPClinical ImplicationsPresentation1st indication of condition is elevated calcium levels identified through routine blood testEven though affected individual may not yet have signs or symptoms of hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemiaBecause excess PTH is caused by abnormalities of parathyroid glands, FIHP is considered form of PHPTTypically, only 1 of 4 parathyroid glands is affected, but > 1 gland involved in some casesTumors are usually adenomasPatients with FIHP may develop parathyroid carcinomaIn contrast to sporadic PHPT, FIHP is characterized by earlier onset of disease, higher incidence of multiglandular involvement, and higher recurrence rateDisruption of normal calcium balance from overactive parathyroids causes signs and symptoms of FIHPKidney stones, nausea, vomiting, hypertension, fatigue, and osteoporosisTreatmentParathyroid surgery is treatment of choice, especially when disorder is complicated by symptomatic hypercalcemia, bone loss or fractures, hypercalciuria, and nephrolithiasisSubtotal parathyroidectomy is recommended for multiglandular involvementAssociated ConditionsPrimary Multiglandular Parathyroid Disease4-gland parathyroid disease is often seen in FIHPMay be either chief cell or oncocytic cell variantsParathyroid AdenomaCommon occurrence in FIHPParathyroid CarcinomaIncreased risk in patients with FIHPPatients with CDC73 or GCM2

beginning at age 10-12 yearsAdenomas and carcinomas have been reported in adolescentsBased on phenotype, annual screening with serum calcium, phosphorous, and PTH levelsEvery 1-2 years, reassessment of renal statusDiagnosisClinicalFamilial PHPT occurs in isolated nonsyndromal form (FIHP) or as part of syndrome, such as MEN1 or HPT-JTClinical picture is of familial PHPT in absence of sufficient

repair deficiency syndromesRare, inherited genetic condition that may lead to bone marrow failure, leukemia, &/or solid tumorsClinically and genetically heterogeneous inherited disorderAutosomal recessive (majority), X-linked recessive (FANCB) (~ 2%), and, rarely, autosomal dominant [RAD51 (FANCR) mutations] patterns of inheritanceCongenital abnormalities in ~ 60% of patients, including VACTERL-H featuresLow birth weight/short statureHypoplastic or absent thumbs &/or radii and deeper cleft between first 2 digitsPigmentation abnormalities (hyperpigmentation, café au lait spots)Renal malformations (horseshoe, hypoplastic)Duodenal atresia or other gastrointestinal malformationsMicrocephaly &/or microphthalmiaCongenital heart diseaseEar abnormalities/deafnessHypogonadismNeurologic abnormalitiesEndocrine dysfunction25-40% of patients are phenotypically normalBone marrow failure presenting in 1st decade of lifeMay begin with one cell line, then pancytopenia develops with marrow aplasia (resulting in anemia, bleeding, and easy bruising)By 5th decade, cumulative incidence of bone marrow failure is 90%Anemia is often macrocyticNeutropenia can result in severe bacterial and fungal infectionsIncreased percentage of Hgb F for ageIncreased risk of hematologic neoplasms and solid tumors (500-700x that of normal individuals)EPIDEMIOLOGYIncidence1 in 100,000-250,000 births and carrier frequency of ~ 1:156-209 (North America)Increased incidence of FA in Ashkenazi Jewish population due to specific FANCC mutations (IVS4 + 4A>T) (carrier frequency of 1.1%)Accounts for ~ 20% of cases of childhood aplastic anemiaAge75% diagnosed between 3-14 years of age10% diagnosed at ≥ 16 years of ageETIOLOGY/PATHOGENESISMolecular PathogenesisMutations, mostly biallelic in any of (at least) 23 separate genes composing FA pathway (FANCA-FANCU)Collectively, proteins encoded by these genes serve to sense DNA damage [interstrand crosslinks (ICLs)] and initiate DNA repairFA pathway proteins fall into 3 separate groups, encoded by following genesFA core complex (core complex detects DNA damage and ubiquitinates ID complex proteins)FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, FANCMFANCA is most frequently mutated gene in this complex (mutations account for ~ 65% of FA cases)Mostly large, intragenic deletions, though point mutations, smaller insertions/deletions, and splicing mutations also occur frequentlyFounder mutations have been described for specific populations, i.e., p.C295T mutation in Spanish Romani, who have highest carrier frequency of FA in world (carrier frequency of 1/64-70)Patients with 2 mutations leading to null alleles have earlier onset of hematologic abnormalities and shorter survival than patients with at least 1 hypomorphic mutationFANCC mutations account for 10-15% of FA casesLess severe hematologic course except for mutations IVS4+4A>T, p.Arg548Ter, and p.Leu554Pro, which have more congenital anomalies and earlier onset of hematologic abnormalitiesFANCG mutations account for ~ 10% of FA casesMore severe cytopenias and higher rates of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia

accurate DNA repair via homologous recombinationBRCA1 protein, which binds to facilitate repair and mediate cell cycle checkpoint controlGenotype-phenotype correlationsSome FANCC mutations predispose to early-onset bone marrow failureIncidence of AML and severe cytopenias is higher in patients with some FANCG and FANCA mutationsPatients with biallelic inactivating mutations in BRCA2 (FANCD1) have 97% cumulative incidence of midline brain tumors, Wilms tumor, and AML (or T-ALL) by 6 years of ageAncillary TestsConfirmation of DiagnosisCytogenetic testingDiagnostic test: Chromosomal breakage/stress cytogenetic test (typically off peripheral blood T lymphocytes)Cells are stimulated and exposed to diepoxybutane &/or mitomycin C and arrested at mitosisNumber of chromosomal breaks and radial formations is counted (in FA, these significantly exceed normal controls)If negative, consider testing nonhematopoietic cells (e.g., cultured skin fibroblasts) because hematopoietic cells can sometimes undergo reversion mutations, which correct original mutation (hematopoietic mosaics)Cannot detect FA carriers with this testCan be performed prenatally (amniotic fluid cells or chorionic villous biopsy)Molecular testingSequence analysis and targeted mutation analysisInitial test should consist of single gene sequencing of FANCA, which is most likely to be affectedCarrier and prenatal testing can be performed by specific mutation testing if familial mutation is knownCell cycle analysis/flow cytometry is alternative to chromosomal breakage test (cells with impaired DNA repair undergo G2 arrest following DNA cross-linking agent exposure)Evaluation for Hematologic MalignancyBone marrow biopsy: Morphologic evaluation is gold standard for diagnosis of MDSCytogenetic analysis:

responsiveness to both conventional chemotherapeutic agents as well as kinase inhibitorsGeneticsGeneral PointsUnderlying genetic cause of many clusters of familial MDS/AML have not yet been elucidatedGiven variable penetrance and latency periods, single germline mutations that have been described likely predispose to MDS/AML by rendering families highly susceptible to additional somatic mutationsTranscription Factor MutationsRUNX1 mutation in FPD/AMLRUNX1 (a.k.a.

in setting of HGBC, DGC is main cause of death in both sexesGermline mutation carriers are advised to undergo life-saving, risk-reducing total gastrectomy; annual endoscopic surveillance is recommended for individuals who decline or wish to postpone surgeryHLBCs share same clinical and evolutionary characteristics as sporadic LBCsBreast cancer risk management is based on active surveillance using imaging; bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy is option depending on patient's choice and family history of LBCGeneticsE-Cadherin/CDH1Mutation in CDH1 (located on 16q22.1) that encodes E-cadherin is identified in 30-40% of patients who fit clinical definition of HDGCAutosomal dominantPenetrance of DGC and LBC in proven CDH1 mutation carriers is incompleteCumulative lifetime risk of DGC is 37-42% for men and 27-33% for women; mean age at onset is ~ 45 years but is extremely variable, ranging from 14-85 years even within same familyLifetime risk of LBC in women is 42-55%; mean age at onset is estimated at 48-53 yearsE-cadherin is cell-cell adhesion protein that acts as tumor suppressor gene2nd hit that inactivates wildtype copy of gene is often due to promoter methylationMay be important mechanism in sporadic DGC and LBCα-Catenin/CTNNA1In absence of germline CDH1 mutation, CTNNA1 must be tested in individual who meets criteria for HGBCMutations in CTNNA1 identified rarely in HDGC families without CDH1 mutation but do not appear, to date, to predispose to LBCCTNNA1 penetrance estimates reported up to 57% lifetime risk of developing DGC in families from European hereditary cancer registriesCLINICAL ISSUESDiagnostic CriteriaPhenotype and localization in stomach or breast are not correlated with location or type of germline CDH1 mutationPatients who fulfill clinical criteria should undergo sequencing of CDH1 and, if negative, in case of DGC should be subsequently tested for CTNNA1In individuals meeting genetic testing criteria, testing should be offered from legal age of consent (generally 16-18 years)Some variability among experts regarding these clinical criteria, as some would test single patient < 45 years with DGC and no family historyNot all HGBC families carrying pathogenic CDH1 mutations are equally at risk for developing DGC, suggesting that environmental factors play synergistic role in GC developmentIn absence of family history of gastric cancer, following criteria should prompt CDH1 germinal testing: 1) Bilateral LBC ± family history of LBC with age at onset < 50 and 2) unilateral LBC with family history of LBC with age at onset > 45Following those criteria, germline CDH1 mutation could be identified in 3% of screened populationUp to 94% of patients with HLBC (without family history of DGC ) who opt for risk-reducing gastrectomy have at least intraepithelial gastric lesions; therefore, annual gastric surveillance and total gastrectomy in case of positive biopsies are recommended in this setting, and risk-reducing total gastrectomy can be discussed in initial consultationPattern of metastasis of DGC and LBC is similar: Spread to peritoneum, gastrointestinal tract, and female reproductive tract is commonFor patients with history of GBC and LBC, it is important to know site of metastasis for therapeutic strategyAncillary TestsCDH1, coding for E-cadherin, is located on chromosome 16q22.1 and consists of 16 exons> 400 CDH1 pathogenic germline variants have been described in HGBC families, so entire gene must be sequencedMost common variants are single nucleotide variants or small insertions/deletions (nonsense, splice site, and frameshift variants), but large copy number variants, mainly deletions, have also been identifiedMutation in CDH1 in 30-40% of patients who fit clinical definition of HDGC2020 International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium defines families as HDGC-like if following criteria are met: 1) CDH1 or CTNNA1 pathogenic variant is not found, 2) there is at least 1 confirmed case of DGC in family, and 3) another gastric cancer or LBC is found in 1st- or 2nd-degree relativesReduced or absent E-cadherin expression by immunohistochemistry is seen in both in situ and invasive components of DGC and LBC, suggesting that inactivation of E-cadherin is early eventIf E-cadherin staining is difficult to interpret, p120 catenin immunohistochemistry can be used as 2nd-line confirmatory test and shows cytoplasmic staining caused by cytosolic translocation of p-catenin in case of mutational loss of E-cadherinBreast cancer metastasis needs to be excluded in patients with DGC as LBC is most common breast cancer subtype to metastasize to stomach and morphologically mimics DGCPanel of immunohistologic markers is used: GATA3, ER, and PR are positive in LBC; cytokeratin 20 and CDX2 are positive in proportion of DGC; cytokeratin 7 is expressed in LBC and in proportion of DGCMICROSCOPICGeneral FeaturesDue to lack of gross lesion, histologic examination of entire grossly normal gastric mucosa of risk-reducing gastrectomy specimen is still standard practice for asymptomatic CDH1 mutation carriersAll reported gastric cancers identified in HDGC families are pure diffuse type2 intraepithelial (or precursor) lesions, in situ carcinoma and pagetoid spread of signet-ring cells (SRCs), have been described in gastric mucosa of CDH1 carriersIn breast, all different subtypes of LBC and in situ LBC can be observedOther histologic subtypes of GC or BC are not associated with HGBCPattern of metastasis of DGC and LBC is similar: Spread to peritoneum, gastrointestinal tract, and female reproductive tract is commonEndoscopic Gastric BiopsiesPreinvasive lesions (pTis in situ)In situ SRC carcinoma (SRCC): Depolarized SRCs that replace nonneoplastic foveolae &/or glands within basement membrane of glands with pagetoid spreadPagetoid spread of SRCs, constituted by linear proliferation of SRCs between preserved gastric epithelium and basal membraneMay also see vacuolization of foveolar epithelium called globoid changeGloboid change by itself is not specific for HDGCE-cadherin is homogeneously lost in preinvasive lesions, indicating that they are distinct histologic feature with high specificity for HBGCIntramucosal invasive SRCC in which classic SRCs invade lamina propria (pT1a)Early intramucosal HDGC foci have been described in 95% of risk-reducing gastrectomies removed from asymptomatic CDH1 mutation carriersIntramucosal invasive SRCC may remain indolent for period of time or disappear, carrying very low risk for disseminationSRCs without expression of Ki-67 or TP532 morphologic populations of SRCs are present in intramucosal carcinomaWell-differentiated large cells are SRCs with abundant mucin, more frequent in upper mucosaSmall cells are SRCs with less mucin and have hyperchromatic and atypical nuclei; more frequent in deeper mucosa levels and isthmus zoneIf unsure about pathology, best to have case reviewed by pathologist who has experience with HDGC casesRisk-Reducing Gastrectomy SpecimensNo gross lesion can be detected in early stages of diseaseAdvanced HDGC demonstrates linitis plastica (entire wall of stomach is infiltrated, creating thickened and rigid stomach)Multiple foci of intramucosal SRCCSome studies suggest most tumors are found at antral transition zone, but this is not reproducibleCareful examination can identify SRCC (mostly multifocal and intramucosal) as well as signet-ring carcinoma in situ in > 90% of these specimensSome patients have hundreds of small in situ lesions, whereas others have only 1 or 2May need to take hundreds of sections to find small in situ lesionsNearly all gastrectomy specimens will have microscopic foci of cancer, but there are documented cases of patients with CDH1 mutations whose risk-reducing gastrectomy specimen did not show any carcinoma despite totally embedding entire stomachAdvanced DGC (pT>1) may be already presentPoorly cohesive gastric cancer, non-SRCC typeIn most cases, at least small amount of SRCCs will be seenE-cadherin expression may be variable: May be retained or subtly diminishedPAS staining is superior to H&E staining for screening risk-reducing gastrectomy specimens from CDH1 mutation carriers; E-cadherin should not be usedBreast SpecimensIn situ and invasive lobular carcinoma in HGBC are indistinguishable from sporadic cancers; classic LBC, most common, is characterized by diffuse infiltration of small round cells with monomorphic nuclei that invade individually or as single files and cordsRisk-reducing mastectomies may contain multiple foci of lobular hyperplasia and in situ carcinomaCancer Risk Management for Gastric CancerGeneral ConsiderationsDGC is main cause of death in both sexes in HGBC families; consequently, germline mutation carriers are advised to undergo life-saving risk-reducing total gastrectomy; annual endoscopic surveillance is recommended for individuals who decline or wish to postpone surgeryUp to 25% of patients who test positive for CDH1 mutation refuse gastrectomyEndoscopic SurveillanceEarly lesions are not evident endoscopically; therefore, extensive sampling is performedCambridge protocol recommends endoscopic sampling at 30 sites throughout entire stomachBethesda protocol recommends to biopsy 22 sites (+ 4 random biopsies/site)Any abnormalities, such as pale areas, nodules, ulcers, umbilicated lesions, should be sampledRisk-Reducing Total GastrectomyTreatment of choice to reduce risk of mortality from gastric cancerProcedure has low mortality rate but high morbidityTiming should be individualized but generally recommended between ages 20-30 in known carriersOthers recommend gastrectomy 5 years earlier than earliest known cancer in individual familyRisk of advanced gastric cancer is < 1% at age 20, 4% at age 30, and 21-46% at age 50Multidisciplinary management (gastroenterology, surgery, nutrition, genetics, psychology) is essential pre- and postoperativelyHDGC-Like IndividualsBecause risk of developing DGC is unclear, endoscopic screening is suggested for at least 2 years beginning at age 40, or 10 years before earliest family history of gastric cancer;

          "CLINICAL ISSUES": "Diagnostic CriteriaPhenotype and localization in stomach or breast are not correlated with location or type of germline CDH1 mutationPatients who fulfill clinical criteria should undergo sequencing of CDH1 and, if negative, in case of DGC should be subsequently tested for CTNNA1In individuals meeting genetic testing criteria, testing should be offered from legal age of consent (generally 16-18 years)Some variability among experts regarding these clinical criteria, as some would test single patient < 45 years with DGC and no family historyNot all HGBC families carrying pathogenic CDH1 mutations are equally at risk for developing DGC, suggesting that environmental factors play synergistic role in GC developmentIn absence of family history of gastric cancer, following criteria should prompt CDH1 germinal testing: 1) Bilateral LBC ± family history of LBC with age at onset < 50 and 2) unilateral LBC with family history of LBC with age at onset > 45Following those criteria, germline CDH1 mutation could be identified in 3% of screened populationUp to 94% of patients with HLBC (without family history of DGC ) who opt for risk-reducing gastrectomy have at least intraepithelial gastric lesions; therefore, annual gastric surveillance and total gastrectomy in case of positive biopsies are recommended in this setting, and risk-reducing total gastrectomy can be discussed in initial consultationPattern of metastasis of DGC and LBC is similar: Spread to peritoneum, gastrointestinal tract, and female reproductive tract is commonFor patients with history of GBC and LBC, it is important to know site of metastasis for therapeutic strategyAncillary TestsCDH1, coding for E-cadherin, is located on chromosome 16q22.1 and consists of 16 exons> 400 CDH1 pathogenic germline variants have been described in HGBC families, so entire gene must be sequencedMost common variants are single nucleotide variants or small insertions/deletions (nonsense, splice site, and frameshift variants), but large copy number variants, mainly deletions, have also been identifiedMutation in CDH1 in 30-40% of patients who fit clinical definition of HDGC2020 International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium defines families as HDGC-like if following criteria are met: 1) CDH1 or CTNNA1 pathogenic variant is not found, 2) there is at least 1 confirmed case of DGC in family, and 3) another gastric cancer or LBC is found in 1st- or 2nd-degree relativesReduced or absent E-cadherin expression by immunohistochemistry is seen in both in situ and invasive components of DGC and LBC, suggesting that inactivation of E-cadherin is early eventIf E-cadherin staining is difficult to interpret, p120 catenin immunohistochemistry can be used as 2nd-line confirmatory test and shows cytoplasmic staining caused by cytosolic translocation of p-catenin in case of mutational loss of E-cadherinBreast cancer metastasis needs to be excluded in patients with DGC as LBC is most common breast cancer subtype to metastasize to stomach and morphologically mimics DGCPanel of immunohistologic markers is used: GATA3, ER, and PR are positive in LBC; cytokeratin 20 and CDX2 are positive in proportion of DGC; cytokeratin 7 is expressed in LBC and in proportion of DGCMICROSCOPICGeneral FeaturesDue to lack of gross lesion, histologic examination of entire grossly normal gastric mucosa of risk-reducing gastrectomy specimen is still standard practice for asymptomatic CDH1 mutation carriersAll reported gastric cancers identified in HDGC families are pure diffuse type2 intraepithelial (or precursor) lesions, in situ carcinoma and pagetoid spread of signet-ring cells (SRCs), have been described in gastric mucosa of CDH1 carriersIn breast, all different subtypes of LBC and in situ LBC can be observedOther histologic subtypes of GC or BC are not associated with HGBCPattern of metastasis of DGC and LBC is similar: Spread to peritoneum, gastrointestinal tract, and female reproductive tract is commonEndoscopic Gastric BiopsiesPreinvasive lesions (pTis in situ)In situ SRC carcinoma (SRCC): Depolarized SRCs that replace nonneoplastic foveolae &/or glands within basement membrane of glands with pagetoid spreadPagetoid spread of SRCs, constituted by linear proliferation of SRCs between preserved gastric epithelium and basal membraneMay also see vacuolization of foveolar epithelium called globoid changeGloboid change by itself is not specific for HDGCE-cadherin is homogeneously lost in preinvasive lesions, indicating that they are distinct histologic feature with high specificity for HBGCIntramucosal invasive SRCC in which classic SRCs invade lamina propria (pT1a)Early intramucosal HDGC foci have been described in 95% of risk-reducing gastrectomies removed from asymptomatic CDH1 mutation carriersIntramucosal invasive SRCC may remain indolent for period of time or disappear, carrying very low risk for disseminationSRCs without expression of Ki-67 or TP532 morphologic populations of SRCs are present in intramucosal carcinomaWell-differentiated large cells are SRCs with abundant mucin, more frequent in upper mucosaSmall cells are SRCs with less mucin and have hyperchromatic and atypical nuclei; more frequent in deeper mucosa levels and isthmus zoneIf unsure about pathology, best to have case reviewed by pathologist who has experience with HDGC casesRisk-Reducing Gastrectomy SpecimensNo gross lesion can be detected in early stages of diseaseAdvanced HDGC demonstrates linitis plastica (entire wall of stomach is infiltrated, creating thickened and rigid stomach)Multiple foci of intramucosal SRCCSome studies suggest most tumors are found at antral transition zone, but this is not reproducibleCareful examination can identify SRCC (mostly multifocal and intramucosal) as well as signet-ring carcinoma in situ in > 90% of these specimensSome patients have hundreds of small in situ lesions, whereas others have only 1 or 2May need to take hundreds of sections to find small in situ lesionsNearly all gastrectomy specimens will have microscopic foci of cancer, but there are documented cases of patients with CDH1 mutations whose risk-reducing gastrectomy specimen did not show any carcinoma despite totally embedding entire stomachAdvanced DGC (pT>1) may be already presentPoorly cohesive gastric cancer, non-SRCC typeIn most cases, at least small amount of SRCCs will be seenE-cadherin expression may be variable: May be retained or subtly diminishedPAS staining is superior to H&E staining for screening risk-reducing gastrectomy specimens from CDH1 mutation carriers; E-cadherin should not be usedBreast SpecimensIn situ and invasive lobular carcinoma in HGBC are indistinguishable from sporadic cancers; classic LBC, most common, is characterized by diffuse infiltration of small round cells with monomorphic nuclei that invade individually or as single files and cordsRisk-reducing mastectomies may contain multiple foci of lobular hyperplasia and in situ carcinomaCancer Risk Management for Gastric CancerGeneral ConsiderationsDGC is main cause of death in both sexes in HGBC families; consequently, germline mutation carriers are advised to undergo life-saving risk-reducing total gastrectomy; annual endoscopic surveillance is recommended for individuals who decline or wish to postpone surgeryUp to 25% of patients who test positive for CDH1 mutation refuse gastrectomyEndoscopic SurveillanceEarly lesions are not evident endoscopically; therefore, extensive sampling is performedCambridge protocol recommends endoscopic sampling at 30 sites throughout entire stomachBethesda protocol recommends to biopsy 22 sites (+ 4 random biopsies/site)Any abnormalities, such as pale areas, nodules, ulcers, umbilicated lesions, should be sampledRisk-Reducing Total Gastrectomy\nTreatment of choice to reduce risk of mortality from gastric cancerProcedure has low mortality rate but high morbidityTiming should be individualized but generally recommended between ages 20-30 in known carriersOthers recommend gastrectomy 5 years earlier than earliest known cancer in individual familyRisk of advanced gastric cancer is < 1% at age 20, 4% at age 30, and 21-46% at age 50Multidisciplinary management (gastroenterology, surgery, nutrition, genetics, psychology) is essential pre- and postoperativelyHDGC-Like IndividualsBecause risk of developing DGC is unclear, endoscopic screening is suggested for at least 2 years beginning at age 40, or 10 years before earliest family history of gastric cancer;

and MR, often no specific featuresOssifying fibromaMay be identified incidentally on imagingRadiography: Well-demarcated, expansile mass with mixed soft tissue density central area with ossified rimBone scan: Increased uptake of affected bonesMACROSCOPICGeneral FeaturesParathyroid adenoma, atypical parathyroid tumor, and carcinoma usually present as single enlarged parathyroidParathyroid adenoma is single enlarged gland, tan to pink-tan, encapsulated ± rim of normal tissueSize: < 1 cm to > 10 cm; weight: 0.2 g to > 1.0 gCystic change may occur in adenomas, particularly larger adenomas, and in those with HPT-JTCystic change historically thought to be common feature, but it is not seen in majority of casesLarger adenomas may show fibrosis, hemosiderin, cystic degeneration, and calcificationAtypical parathyroid tumorSingle enlarged parathyroid glandParathyroid carcinomas are generally larger than atypical parathyroid tumor but overlap in sizeCan be difficult to differentiate atypical parathyroid tumor from carcinoma grossly and surgicallyLobulated appearance due to thick, fibrous bandsLarge tumors can be fibrotic, adhere to adjacent structuresParathyroid carcinomas may be large, firm, variably encapsulated, poorly circumscribedLarge tumors (mean: 6.7 g; range: 1.5 g to > 50 g)Carcinomas are often larger than adenomas and atypical parathyroid tumors but overlap in sizeLobulated appearance due to thick, fibrous bandsMay be grossly encapsulated, resemble adenomaMay adhere or invade adjacent structuresCaution as large adenomas, especially cystic, can be fibrotic and adhere to adjacent structuresOssifying fibroma shows central pink-yellow fibrous tissue surrounded by pale yellow, dense, peripheral ossified tissueMICROSCOPICGeneral FeaturesHyperparathyroidismSmall but significant number of parathyroid gland excisions may be due to heritable diseaseHistologic features of parafibromin-deficient parathyroid tumors include sheet-like growth, staghorn vessels with arborizing vasculature, nuclear enlargement, occasional multinucleation, perinuclear cytoplasmic clearing, and eosinophilic cytoplasmCaused by parathyroid adenoma, atypical parathyroid tumor, or carcinomaCystic changes may occurParathyroid adenoma, atypical parathyroid tumor, and parathyroid carcinoma are all hypercellularFibrosis, if present in adenoma, is usually focal but more extensive and often intratumoral or peritumoral in atypical parathyroid tumor and carcinomaFibrous bands can occur in adenoma but are more prominent in atypical parathyroid tumor and carcinomaFibrosis and hemosiderin with prior trauma to parathyroid, such as from needle biopsyThickened capsule can be seen in adenoma, atypical parathyroid tumor, and parathyroid carcinomaTumor cells may be entrapped in capsule, but invasion requires definitive growth through capsuleIn adenoma and atypical parathyroid tumor, cells do not extend beyond capsule into soft tissue or adjacent structures as may be seen in carcinomaMust differentiate invasion from entrapped cellsNecrosis is usually only seen in parathyroid carcinomaMitotic figures can be seen in adenoma, atypical parathyroid tumor, and carcinoma but are most prominent in carcinomaKi-67 > 5% is more common in carcinoma than adenoma and atypical parathyroid tumorAtypical mitotic figures only in carcinomaTumor cells are usually chief cells but can have oncocytic cells and transitional cellsCytologic atypia is usually seen in parathyroid carcinoma, but it is not definitive of malignancyCytologic atypia must be differentiated from \"endocrine atypia\" in benign parathyroid diseaseGrowth patterns may be variable, but monotonous, sheet-like, and trabecular growth are concerning features often seen in parathyroid carcinomaVascular invasion is only seen in parathyroid carcinomaCaution in differentiating vascular invasion from artifactual dislodgement of tumor cellsPerineural invasion is only seen in carcinomaInvasion of adjacent structures only occurs in carcinomaHistologic features suggestive of underlying CDC73 mutation include sheet-like pattern of

jawMicroscopically, densely cellular, well-defined, fibrous tumor that ossifies beginning at peripheryTumor composed of dense, relatively avascular, fibroblast-rich stroma and irregular spicules of woven bone with osteoblastic rimmingANCILLARY TESTSImmunohistochemistryParathyroid tissue is positive for neuroendocrine markers, such as chromogranin-A, INSM1, and may be positive for synaptophysinPTH and GATA3 are positiveKeratin is positive, particularly CAM5.2Negative for TTF-1, thyroglobulin, calcitonin (usually), and monoclonal PAX8p27, E-cadherin, 5hmC, BCL2, MDM2, and p53 may be helpful, particularly when used in combinationsKi-67 is < 5% in benign parathyroid disease, while parathyroid carcinoma often has Ki-67 of > 5%No individual biomarker is definitive, but combination of multiple markers may be helpfulParafibrominEncoded by CDC73, parafibromin often shows complete nuclear absence in carcinoma (familial and sporadic) and is retained in sporadic adenomas and sporadic atypical parathyroid tumorsIn HPT-JT, parathyroid disease, whether benign or malignant, usually shows loss of nuclear parafibromin reflecting underlying CDC73 mutationParafibromin-deficient neoplasm: Tumor showing complete absence of nuclear parafibromin staining in all tumor cells with preserved staining in nonneoplastic cellsPartial loss or reduction of parafibromin staining rather than complete nuclear absence of parafibromin may raise possibility of CDC73 deficiency but can be due to technical issuesLoss of nucleolar parafibromin only with retained nuclear staining may be associated with CDC73 mutation, but this remains less certainAs loss of nucleolar parafibromin expression does suggest possibility of underlying genetic abnormality, genetic testing is suggestedIndividuals with parafibromin-deficient parathyroid neoplasm should undergo CDC73 sequencing for germline mutation, which can occur de novo in individuals with no family historyMost parafibromin-deficient tumors have germline CDC73 mutation, but somatic inactivating CDC73 mutation, often in combination with loss of remaining allele or biallelic somatic only mutations, can occurSomatic biallelic CDC73 mutation occurs but uncommonAbsence of parafibromin loss does not rule out possibility of CDC73 mutationParafibromin nuclear expression may be preserved in HPT-JT as some point mutations in CDC73 may not be associated with loss of nuclear parafibromin expression, thus preserved nuclear parafibromin expression does not exclude CDC73 mutationSomatic CDC73 mutations often occur in sporadic parathyroid carcinomaParafibromin expression may have utility predicting outcome in atypical parathyroid tumorsParafibromin-positive atypical parathyroid tumors usually do not recurParafibromin-negative tumors may recur and may be considered tumors of low malignant potentialParafibromin immunostain helpful but requires rigorously controlled testingParathyroid carcinoma or parafibromin-deficient tumor is indication for germline genetic testingParafibromin is not useful in determining whether or not ossifying fibroma occurring in setting of HPT-JTGenetic TestingDNA-based

inactivationClinical testing may not identify all mutations as inactivating CDC73 mutations may be located outside coding region evaluatedCDC73 mutation is uncommon in sporadic adenomasSomatic CDC73 mutations are common in sporadic parathyroid carcinomas and rare in sporadic adenomas but can be seen in adenomas in HPT-JTComplete loss of parafibromin (CDC73) protein expression helpful in separating parathyroid carcinoma from adenoma and atypical parathyroid tumor; however, parafibromin expression may be lost in all parathyroid tumors associated with germline CDC73 mutationsParathyroid

FraumeniIntroductionLi-Fraumeni SyndromeIn 1969, Frederick Li and Joseph Fraumeni recognized unusual pattern of cancers in 4 families with autosomal dominant transmissionFamily members developed wide variety of different types of cancersSyndrome-related cancers developed at different ages at different frequency0-15 years: Sarcomas, adrenal cortical carcinomas, brain tumors, leukemia16-50 years: Sarcomas, breast carcinomas, brain tumors, leukemia> 50 years: Breast carcinomas, sarcomas, lung carcinomas, prostate carcinomasLFS was discovered to be due to pathogenic germline mutations in TP53, key tumor suppressor gene involved in maintenance of genomic stabilityAutosomal dominant inheritanceLFS is characterized by high phenotypic heterogeneity with wide spectrum of tumors developing at unusually young agesCumulative cancer risk ~ 50% by age 40, ~ 90% by age 60Broader genetic testing is identifying individuals with germline TP53 mutations without typical family historiesThese individuals generally have mutations of lower penetrance or lower pathogenicity or have de novo mutationsLi-Fraumeni-like syndrome has been used to refer to individuals who do not fulfill all clinical criteria for LFS20-40% have germline TP53 mutations and are classified as having LFSOther individuals may have germline mutations in genes such as BRCA2, Fanconi genes (BRIP1, PALB2, and RAD51C), and DNA mismatch repair genesEpidemiologyIncidence of TP53 Germline Mutations~ 1/5,000 to 1/20,000 individuals have pathogenic mutationsHowever, broader screening has identified germline mutations in up to 1/400-800 individualsMutations associated with cancers, but not associated with classic LFS history, show lower penetrance and cancers occur at older ageMutations not yet associated with cancer are of uncertain significanceModels being developed in order to help determine if newly detected mutation is likely to be pathogenicOne population in southeastern Brazil has 1/300 incidenceDue to specific mutation R337H (c.1010G > A, p.Arg337His)Lifetime risk for cancer: ~ 50-60%Adrenal cortical carcinoma is most common cancer to be diagnosed 1st in all age groupsAdults also develop breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma (STS), and choroid plexus carcinoma~ 12% of Brazilian women who present with breast cancer at < 45 years have this mutationIncidence Among Women With Breast CarcinomaTP53 germline mutations associated with ~ 6% of breast carcinomas in women < 31 years of ageResponsible for ~ 3% of all breast cancers due to germline mutationModifiers of RiskType of TP53 germline mutation alters age of onsetMissense mutationsDominant-negative missense mutations result in abnormal protein that interferes with function of normal proteinResults in defect in p53 from time of conception1st tumor has earlier age of onsetOccurs in majority of pediatric patientsOther missense mutations result in proteins that gain functions that promote tumorsLoss-of-function mutations (e.g., nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, genomic rearrangements) likely require 2nd event to alter p53 functionSomatic mutations in TP53 &/or inactivation of protein p53 are most common alterations detected in all cancers1st tumor in LFS has later age of onsetType of TP53 mutation alters penetranceDominant-negative missense mutations are more highly penetrant (more individuals develop tumors) than other types of mutationsChemotherapy and radiation therapy for 1st tumor likely contribute to subsequent cancersMultiple primary tumors occur in ~ 40% of LFS patients~ 1/3 of LFS patients develop 2nd tumors in radiation fieldsSexMedian age of developing 1st cancer is higher in females compared to males (28 years vs. 17 years) due to large number of breast cancersIf breast cancers are excluded, median age of 1st cancer in females is ~ 13 years vs. ~ 17 years for malesAfter age 20, incidence of breast cancer in females results in higher overall cancer rates compared to malesLifetime risk: ~ 100% for females, ~ 75% for malesOther modifying factorsGenomic changes, such as TP53 polymorphisms, p53 inhibitor MDM2 variants, miR-605 microRNA variants, and telomere length, may influence clinical characteristics (e.g., age of 1st tumor)GeneticsTP53Located on 17p13.120 kb, 11 coding exons, 393 amino acidsAutosomal dominant inheritanceMissense mutations: Majority of cases (~ 75%)Most are within central DNA binding domain: 85% in exons 5-8Alter DNA binding capacity or destabilize 3D structure of proteinAltered protein can have dominant-negative effect: Abnormal protein interferes with function of wildtype proteinOccurs in ~ 1/3 of affected LFS familiesAll cells have abnormal p53 function from birth without need for additional mutationsResults in earlier age of diagnosis of 1st tumorUnlike other germline tumor suppressor genes, 2/3 of tumors in individuals with missense mutations retain wildtype alleleRetention likely due to lower selective pressure to lose wildtype proteinNull mutations: Minority of casesMay be due to nonsense or splice site mutations, deletions, or insertionsResults in nonfunctional proteinLoss or inactivation of wildtype allele is necessary to alter normal TP53 functionLike other germline tumor suppressor genes, majority of tumors exhibit loss of wildtype alleleTP53 mutation database maintained by International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), updated each year> 1,500 germline mutations currently includedFunction of p53 ProteinTranscription factor with central role to upregulate genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA replication, DNA repair, apoptosis, and senescence, in response to DNA damageBinds to double-stranded DNATransactivation function for promoter sequencesActivated in response to various stress signalsProtects cells against genomic changes resulting from DNA damagep53 provides mechanism of protection against accumulation of genetic alterationsActivates DNA repair proteins when DNA has been damagedCell cycle arrest allows repair of genetic damage prior to DNA replication and fixation of mutationsTerminally damaged cells undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death)Central role of p53 as tumor suppressor has led to its title as \"guardian of genome\"Immunohistochemistry for p53p53 protein degrades rapidly with only 20-minute half-lifeSome mutant forms of p53 cannot transcriptionally activate MDM2Loss of this negative feedback loop results in p53 accumulationMany antibodies to p53 are availableTarget different epitopes on proteinMay detect only wildtype protein, mutant protein, or bothDifferent patterns of positivity observed in tumorsAbnormal pattern; complete absence: All cells negativeMay correlate with genomic alterations resulting in absence of p53 expression (e.g., deletions, nonsense, splice site mutations)Wildtype pattern: Mixture of negative cells and weak to strongly staining cellsMay correlate with presence of normal TP53However, some splice site mutations or truncating mutations can result in nonfunctional p53 that mimics normal patternSeen in normal tissuesMay be activated in response to inflammation or other stress signalsAbnormal pattern; overexpression: Diffuse strong positivity in majority of cellsOften correlates with mutations that stabilize protein (~ 96% of missense mutations)Some mutant forms of p53 have half-lives of up to 4 hoursImmunohistochemistry

tissueMost MSI-H tumors will be sporadic due to methylation of mismatch repair genesMost of these will be due to methylation of MLH1Presence of BRAF V600E mutation excludes Lynch syndrome in MSI-H tumorsThis can now be detected using immunohistochemistry for BRAF V600EMay also test for methylation of MLH1, as presence of methylation usually excludes Lynch syndromeNot all CRC in Lynch are MSI-H (5-10%)Immunoperoxidase stains for mismatch repair proteinsAntibodies for 4 major mismatch repair gene proteins are commercially availableLack of staining in tumor cells indicative of deficient proteinAlways need to compare tumor to adjacent inflammatory cells to make sure stain worked (internal positive control)In rare cases of constitutional mismatch repair deficiency, there will be no staining of nonneoplastic cells since both copies are knocked outDirect sequencing of mismatch repair genes for mutationsOnce missing protein is determined using immunostains, gene should be sequenced to identify specific mutation for family screeningIn some cases, no germline mutation will be found despite presence of MSI-H tumor with absent mismatch repair protein expressionIn these cases, it appears that biallelic somatic inactivation is causeThis has been termed Lynch-like syndromeNo single test or combination of tests is both cost-effective and sensitive/specificMost laboratories use algorithm starting with either MSI testing by PCR or immunostainsNext-generation sequencing can detect MSI-H and identify specific Lynch mutationsAs price drops, this will likely replace
