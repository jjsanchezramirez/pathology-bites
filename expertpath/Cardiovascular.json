mutation, characterized by palmar and plantar keratoses and thick, woolly hairCarvajal syndrome: Desmoplakin mutation, predominant LV involvementEnvironmental factorsCombination of genetic and environmental factors, especially exercise, appears to play role in pathogenesis of diseasePathogenesis3 main hypotheses explain pathogenesis of diseaseHypothesis 1: Occurs due to mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins, causing disruption of intercalated discs and connections between myocardial cellsHypothesis 2: Occurs due to genetic defects in immune system that increase myocardial susceptibility to viral infections causing inflammation (myocarditis)Both mechanisms can lead to myocardial cell death, apoptosis, and fibrofatty tissue replacementHypothesis 3: Occurs due to transdifferentiation of cardiac progenitor cells in myocardium into fibrofatty tissueDysregulation of canonical wingless-Int (WNT), Hippo, and TGF-β signaling pathways have been involved in fibroadipogenesisTissue transformation is most common in triangle of dysplasia, located between infundibulum, RV apex, and inferior or diaphragmatic aspect of RVTransmural loss of myocardium occurs in

family Reduviidae, subfamily Triatominae, genus Triatoma (\"Mexican bed bugs\")T. cruzi is present in bug's fecesKissing bug bites host (human), then defecatesPruritic bite causes unsuspecting host to scratch feces into bite, causing dissemination of metacyclic trypomastigotes through skin into bloodstreamTrypomastigotes then colonize muscle and neuronal tissue, encyst, and form amastigotesHost cell swells and amastigotes grow flagella and morph back into trypomastigotes that spread via lymphatics and blood to distant sitesCycle is continued when reduviid bugs bite infected host, ingest blood along with trypomastigotes, and transmit parasite to next hostBlood transfusions, organ transplantation, vertical transmission from mother to infant, oral contamination, and laboratory exposure

pain, presyncope, syncope, dyspnea upon exertion, edema, and thromboembolic eventsCardiac rhythm irregularities, gallop rhythms, displaced point of maximal impulse, loud 2nd heart sound, mitral or tricuspid regurgitation murmurs, liver enlargement, and low systolic blood pressureInitially, EKG changes includeLeft anterior fascicular block (LAFB), incomplete or complete right bundle branch block (RBBB), premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and minimal ST-T changesIn advanced disease, EKG may demonstrateRBBB, LAFB, polymorphic PVCs, high-grade atrioventricular blocks, bradyarrhythmias, Q waves, ventricular tachycardia, and, eventually, atrial fibrillation or flutterDigestive tract and nervous system involvementDestruction of nerves and dilatation of GI tract can lead to megaesophagus or megacolon and cause digestive problems &/or severe weight lossNeuritis develops in ~ 10% of patients and can lead to sensory impairment and altered deep tendon reflexes, but this is quite rareOther much rarer neurologic symptoms can include: Dementia, confusion, chronic encephalopathy, and sensorineural or motor deficitsCongenital diseaseSigns can include prematurity, hepatosplenomegaly, meningitis, &/or encephalitisLaboratory TestsLeukocytosis and lymphocytosis are common findings\nTreatmentOptions, risks, complications\nTreatment is recommended in acute and congenital infection, reactivated infection, early chronic Chagas disease, and infected adults without advanced cardiomyopathy\nTreatment is contraindicated in patients with megaesophagus and swallowing impairmentSymptomatic treatment of heart disease parallels medical treatment for heart failure of other causesSurgical approachesTransplantation for end-stage chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy is increasingly being usedSurvival probability is increased vs. end-stage patients who do not receive heart transplantRisk of Chagas disease reactivation in transplanted hearts (risk correlates with increasing amount of immunosuppressive therapy)However, can be easily treated with benznidazole or allopurinolMorbidity is high with disease reactivation, but mortality is lowChagas transplant patients have equal incidence of rejection as non-Chagas heart transplant recipientsDrugsOnly 2 drugs approved for treatment: Benznidazole and nifurtimoxNumerous side effects associated with both drugs\nPrognosisAcute Chagas diseaseMost patients return to full or near-normal cardiac status, but~ 30% develop chronic fibrosing myocarditisDeath can occur rarely (~ 5-10% of symptomatic patients) as result ofCongestive heart failure, secondary to severe acute myocarditisMeningoencephalitisChronic Chagas diseaseNormal life expectancy for patients in early stages of cardiomyopathyLife expectancy for late-stage symptomatic or advanced cardiomyopathy with cardiomegaly or systolic dysfunction ≤ 30% at 5 yearsCauses of death include heart failure (25-30%) and sudden death (55-65%)Survival probability for transplant recipients at 1 year is 71% and at 10 years is 46%MACROSCOPICGeneral FeaturesCardiomegaly with apical aneurysm with thrombus formation is common, distinctive finding of

chronicum migrans (ECM) is classic clinical manifestationECM (seen in ~ 80% of patients) occurs as erythematous target-like patch typically > 5 cm in diameter 7-14 days after tick bite and increases in size over days to weeksLymphadenitis, headache, myalgias, fever, and malaise may also be present during this stage2nd-stage LD (disseminated) results from hematogenous spread, occurs weeks to months after 1st stage, and may show cardiac arrhythmias, secondary annular plaques (usually smaller), migratory arthritis, and meningitis3rd stage of LD (late, chronic) occurs 2-3 years after 1st stage and is characterized byAcrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (typically seen in Europe), which presents as reddish blue discoloration of skin without scalingNeuropathy, arthritis, meningoencephalitis, and other nonspecific signs can occurIn LD, most common cardiac manifestations are conduction and rhythm disturbancesAtrioventricular (AV) block is most common conduction

possible presentationsPericarditis with pericardial effusion has been reportedAnecdotal reports of dilated cardiomyopathy, but this has been disputed by several studiesFor RMSF, incubation period varies from 2 days to 2 weeksEarly symptoms are nonspecific with fever, malaise, chills, headaches, anorexia, and myalgiasClassic clinical triad is sudden onset of fever, rash, and headacheRash

common, occurring in ~ 1/2 of patientsTreatmentOptions, risks, complicationsWith suspicious clinical features and appropriate epidemiology, RMSF treatment should be started before serology or ancillary tests are positiveHowever, without suspicious clinical symptoms, prophylactic therapy is not recommended after tick bite since even in endemic areas, ≤ 1% of ticks are infected with R.

hypersensitivity reactions to tetracyclinesRelative contraindication is pregnant womenFor children with suspected LD under 8 years of age, doxycycline is contraindicatedChloramphenicol is only alternative therapy for RMSFOral amoxicillin or cefuroxime can also be used for LDIn patients with Lyme carditis and severe conduction abnormalities, IV ceftriaxone or high-dose penicillin G recommendedCotrimoxazole is 2nd-line therapy for acute Q fever in pregnant women and young childrenChronic Q fever often requires multiple drugs (difficult to treat)Doxycycline with quinolones or

however, there are 2-3 clinical contraindicationsMajor exception is patients with history of serious hypersensitivity reactions to tetracyclinesRelative contraindication is pregnant womenFor children with suspected LD under 8 years of age, doxycycline is contraindicatedChloramphenicol is only alternative therapy for RMSFOral amoxicillin or cefuroxime can also be used for LDIn patients with Lyme carditis and severe conduction abnormalities, IV ceftriaxone or high-dose penicillin G recommendedCotrimoxazole is 2nd-line therapy for acute Q fever in pregnant women and young childrenChronic Q fever often requires multiple drugs (difficult to treat)Doxycycline with quinolones or doxycycline with hydroxychloroquine are 2 main therapy optionsPacemakerTemporary transvenous pacing may be necessary in selected cases\nPrognosisLyme carditis> 90% of patients completely recoverMortality related to Lyme myocarditis is exceedingly rareRMSFPoorly understood geographic variation of RMSF virulenceMortality rates in preantibiotic era varied significantly even between neighboring statesUntreated mortality rate of RMSF is ~ 20%;

factors, especially exercise, appears to play role in pathogenesis of diseasePathogenesis3 main hypotheses explain pathogenesis of diseaseHypothesis 1: Occurs due to mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins, causing disruption of intercalated discs and connections between myocardial cellsHypothesis 2: Occurs due to genetic defects in immune system that increase myocardial susceptibility to viral infections causing inflammation (myocarditis)Both mechanisms can lead to myocardial cell death, apoptosis, and fibrofatty tissue replacementHypothesis 3: Occurs due to transdifferentiation of cardiac progenitor cells in myocardium into fibrofatty tissueDysregulation of canonical wingless-Int (WNT), Hippo, and TGF-β signaling pathways have been involved in fibroadipogenesisTissue transformation is most common in triangle of dysplasia, located between infundibulum, RV apex, and inferior or diaphragmatic aspect of RVTransmural loss of myocardium occurs in

family Reduviidae, subfamily Triatominae, genus Triatoma (\"Mexican bed bugs\")T. cruzi is present in bug's fecesKissing bug bites host (human), then defecatesPruritic bite causes unsuspecting host to scratch feces into bite, causing dissemination of metacyclic trypomastigotes through skin into bloodstreamTrypomastigotes then colonize muscle and neuronal tissue, encyst, and form amastigotesHost cell swells and amastigotes grow flagella and morph back into trypomastigotes that spread via lymphatics and blood to distant sitesCycle is continued when reduviid bugs bite infected host, ingest blood along with trypomastigotes, and transmit parasite to next hostBlood transfusions, organ transplantation, vertical transmission from mother to infant, oral contamination, and laboratory exposure are also ways in which T. cruzi infection can be acquiredPathogenesis of Chronic Heart DiseaseVery complex process that is still being studiedStill not fully understood whether cardiac lesions from chronic disease are result ofParasite directlyImmune reaction directly to parasite itselfAutoimmunity elicited directly by parasite (molecular mimicry)Autoimmunity elicited indirectly by parasite (innocent bystander)Most likely explanation is combination of low-grade chronic systemic infection with associated autoimmune reactionLow-grade chronic infection leads directly to myocardial damage, necrosis, and nervous tissue damage leading to cardiac dilatation and failure, arrhythmias, &/or sudden cardiac deathOther component to pathogenesis (autoimmune reaction) is most likely result

rickettsial bacteria in North America is R. rickettsii, which causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF)Transmitted by ticks, and bacteria invade and proliferate in endothelial cells of small vesselsEndothelial damage and dysfunction leads to activation of acute-phase response, coagulation abnormalities, cytokine activation, and resultant immune dysregulationHost response not as well understood, but cell-mediated response thought to be importantC. burnetii is rickettsial organism responsible for Q feverCLINICAL ISSUESEpidemiologyIncidenceLyme carditis is rare manifestation (1-10% of cases in USA, 0.5-4.0% in Europe)LD occurs in USA, Canada, South America, and temperate areas of Europe and AsiaIn USA, most cases of LD are concentrated in states in Northeast, Wisconsin, or MinnesotaHowever, nearly all states (except HI, AR, MS, WY, and OK) have had confirmed cases in past 10 yearsHeart involvement in both RMSF and Q fever is quite rareIn 2 different large case series, < 1% of Q fever patients experienced myocarditisChronic Q fever accounts for < 5% of acutely infected patientsSexLyme carditisM:F = 3:1PresentationIn 1st stage of LD (localized, acute), erythema chronicum migrans (ECM) is classic clinical manifestationECM (seen in ~ 80% of patients) occurs as erythematous target-like patch typically > 5 cm in diameter 7-14 days after tick bite and increases in size over days to weeksLymphadenitis, headache, myalgias, fever, and malaise may also be present during this stage2nd-stage LD (disseminated) results from hematogenous spread, occurs weeks to months after 1st stage, and may show cardiac arrhythmias, secondary annular plaques (usually smaller), migratory arthritis, and meningitis3rd stage of LD (late, chronic) occurs 2-3 years after 1st stage and is characterized byAcrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (typically seen in Europe), which presents as reddish blue discoloration of skin without scalingNeuropathy, arthritis, meningoencephalitis, and other nonspecific signs can occurIn LD, most common cardiac manifestations are conduction and rhythm disturbancesAtrioventricular (AV) block is most common conduction abnormalityCan rapidly progress from 1st to 3rd degreeEscape rhythms with severe AV block, brief asystoles, and fluctuating bundle branch blocks can also occurMyocarditis and cardiomyopathy are other possible presentationsPericarditis with pericardial effusion has been reportedAnecdotal reports of dilated cardiomyopathy, but this has been disputed by several studiesFor RMSF, incubation period varies from 2 days to 2 weeksEarly symptoms are nonspecific with fever, malaise, chills, headaches, anorexia, and myalgiasClassic clinical triad is sudden onset of fever, rash, and headacheRash develops in most patients 3-5 days after exposure and consists of macular, blanching, nonpruritic rashLater, it becomes papular, and petechiae may be presentRarely, it may progress to ischemia and skin necrosisCentripetal spread from wrists inward actually occurs in minority of patientsPalm and sole involvement, although characteristic, may not be present until late stage or absent altogetherCardiac involvement in RMSF is rareCardiac dysfunction related to myocarditis can occurSigns of pericarditis or arterial occlusion can also occurIn severe RMSF, cardiac failure can ensueMyocardial infarctions and heart block can also occurClinically, Q fever symptoms are nonspecific in both acute and chronic formsAcuteOften no symptomsMild symptoms can include flu-like symptoms, malaise, severe headaches, myalgias, and othersMost patients recover, but rarer serious complications include pneumonia, myocarditis, granulomatous hepatitis, or meningoencephalitisChronicMost often presents as endocarditis or aneurysmal or vascular graft infectionChronic hepatitis or arthritis are also possible presentationsMyocarditis is rare complication (~ 20 cases reported in literature) However, it can be fatalMost common symptomsDyspneaChest painPalpitations Laboratory TestsRMSFMost patients have thrombocytopenia, and liver enzyme tests are often elevatedHyponatremia is also quite common, occurring in ~ 1/2 of patientsTreatmentOptions, risks, complicationsWith suspicious clinical features and appropriate epidemiology, RMSF treatment should be started before serology or ancillary tests are positiveHowever, without suspicious clinical symptoms, prophylactic therapy is not recommended after tick bite since even in endemic areas, ≤ 1% of ticks are infected with R. rickettsiiDrugsDoxycycline is drug of choice for all patients with LD, RMSF, and acute Q fever; however, there are 2-3 clinical contraindicationsMajor exception is patients with history of serious hypersensitivity reactions to tetracyclinesRelative contraindication is pregnant womenFor children with suspected LD under 8 years of age, doxycycline is contraindicatedChloramphenicol is only alternative therapy for RMSFOral amoxicillin or cefuroxime can also be used for LDIn patients with Lyme carditis and severe conduction abnormalities, IV ceftriaxone or high-dose penicillin G recommendedCotrimoxazole is 2nd-line therapy for acute Q fever in pregnant women and young childrenChronic Q fever often requires multiple drugs (difficult to treat)Doxycycline with quinolones or doxycycline with hydroxychloroquine are 2 main therapy optionsPacemakerTemporary transvenous pacing may be necessary in selected casesPrognosisLyme carditis> 90% of patients completely recoverMortality related to Lyme myocarditis is exceedingly rareRMSFPoorly understood geographic variation of RMSF virulenceMortality rates in preantibiotic era varied significantly even between

however, there are 2-3 clinical contraindicationsMajor exception is patients with history of serious hypersensitivity reactions to tetracyclinesRelative contraindication is pregnant womenFor children with suspected LD under 8 years of age, doxycycline is contraindicatedChloramphenicol is only alternative therapy for RMSFOral amoxicillin or cefuroxime can also be used for LDIn patients with Lyme carditis and severe conduction abnormalities, IV ceftriaxone or high-dose penicillin G recommendedCotrimoxazole is 2nd-line therapy for acute Q fever in pregnant women and young childrenChronic Q fever often requires multiple drugs (difficult to treat)Doxycycline with quinolones or doxycycline with hydroxychloroquine are 2 main therapy optionsPacemakerTemporary transvenous pacing may be necessary in selected cases\nPrognosisLyme carditis> 90% of patients completely recoverMortality related to Lyme myocarditis is exceedingly rareRMSFPoorly understood geographic variation of RMSF virulenceMortality rates in preantibiotic era varied significantly even between neighboring statesUntreated mortality rate of RMSF is ~ 20%;
