nutrient absorptionSteatorrhea: Presence of pale, bulky, and foul-smelling stools with high fat content (> 14 g per day), resulting from malabsorption, which may be caused by small intestinal mucosal disease, insufficient bile acid concentration, small-bowel bacterial overgrowth, or pancreatic exocrine insufficiencyLaboratory DiagnosisLow fecal pH (< 5.3) is characteristic for diarrhea caused by carbohydrate malabsorption, whereas fecal pH > 5.6 argues against carbohydrate malabsorption as cause of diarrheaOsmotic diarrhea produces stool with low levels of electrolytes, with osmotic gap > 50-75 mOsm/kgSecretory diarrhea produces stool isoosmolar with plasma, and so leads to osmotic gap of stool < 50 mOsm/kg; may have associated serum hypokalemia and acidosisFecal immunochemical test detects globin component of hemoglobin rather than heme component, and so is more sensitive and specific than stool guaiac testingCLINICAL CORRELATESPathophysiologyMajority of water and electrolytes are absorbed in small intestines, with net amount of 800-1,000 mL of fluid entering colonAbsorption of nutrients and water across small intestinal mucosa is driven by active transport of ions (principally Na+, Cl−, and HCO3−) via membrane-associated channels, endocytic uptake, and paracellular channelsNormal nutrient absorptionRequires processing at luminal and brush border, absorption into intestinal mucosa, and transport into circulationMalabsorptionPathologic state of impaired nutrient absorption in gastrointestinal (GI) tract and can result from disruption of any step involved in nutrient absorptionDiarrheaCharacterized by reduced stool consistency due to incomplete absorption of water and electrolytes by intestineMay result from variety of processes, including altered electrolyte absorption or secretion, as well as presence of osmotically active substances that accumulate in intestinal lumenChronic diarrhea = passage of loose stools for > 4 weeksCauses of chronic diarrhea can be classified as inflammatory, osmotic, secretory, iatrogenic, disrupted motility, and functional diseaseInflammatory diarrhea [e.g., inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)]Presents with malabsorption or rectal bleeding and may be accompanied by other symptoms, such as mucus and blood in stool, abdominal pain, or extraintestinal symptoms involving skin, eyes, and jointsIn ulcerative colitis, main pathogenesis of diarrhea is decrease in net absorption of sodium, chloride, and water from lumen of colonOsmotic diarrheaOccurs when osmotically active substances draw fluid from plasma into jejunumMay result from bacterial overgrowth, osmotic laxatives, disaccharidase deficiency, or pancreatic exocrine insufficiencySecretory diarrheaResults from secretion of isoosmolar fluid, leading to hypokalemia and acidosisMay result from disease states such as VIPoma or congenital chloridorrheaIatrogenic diarrheaMotility disordersCan result in diarrhea by overwhelming reabsorptive capacity of colon in cases of rapid transit disorders or slow transit disorders (such as bacterial overgrowth, which leads to bile acid deconjugation, poor micelle formation, and steatorrhea)Altered gut motility can be associated with variety of disease conditions, including postsurgical states, carcinoid syndromes, diabetes, or infiltrative small bowel diseaseFunctional diseaseFunctional disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, can also lead to diarrheaSteatorrheaPresence of pale, bulky, and foul-smelling stools with high fat content resulting from malabsorptionMay result from small intestinal mucosal disease, insufficient bile acid concentration, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, or pancreatic exocrine insufficiencyBile acids are required for absorption of dietary fats and sterols from intestinePancreatic exocrine insufficiency is most common cause of severe steatorrhea90% of pancreatic acinar tissue must be destroyed before patient develops symptomatic pancreatic exocrine insufficiencyMilder forms of steatorrhea can occur with mucosal or structural diseaseCarbohydrate malabsorptionUsually results from mucosal disease, and subsequent bacterial metabolism of carbohydrates in colon leads to symptoms such as bloating, abdominal cramping, passing of gas, flatulence, and diarrheaLactose intolerance may result from deficiency of intestinal brush border enzyme lactase or small bowel injury (as in Celiac disease, or transiently after acute diarrheal illness)Lactase activity decreases rapidly in most non-white population groups after 2 years of age; a relative lactase deficiency should be regarded as normal in these individualsFructose deficiency can result in similar symptomsLABORATORY DIAGNOSISSpecimen CollectionStool should be collected into bedpan or boiled glass jarInstruct patients not to contaminate outside of container and not to overfill itOverfilling stool containers can result in explosive release of contents due to accumulation of gasGross ExaminationStool with steatorrhea is typically gray and foul-smelling; floats on waterClay-colored stool suggests absence of bile or presence of barium sulfateUpper GI bleeding, bismuth, and iron may cause stool to be blackLower digestive bleeding or beets may cause stool to be redMucus in stool specimens is abnormal and should be reportedFecal CalprotectinCalprotectin: Protein released by activated neutrophils and therefore marker of inflammationCan be used to distinguish inflammatory disorders from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)Sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 94% at 50 µg/gSensitivities and specificities are higher than that of lactoferrin, which is another marker of inflammationFalse-positives can occur with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)MicroscopySudan stains can be used to microscopically evaluate for neutral fats, which appear as large orange or red droplets> 60 droplets per HPF indicates steatorrheaAddition of acetic acid with Sudan staining can evaluate for fatty acids and soaps> 100 droplets per HPF indicates steatorrheaPancreatic disease is more likely to result in steatorrhea with increased fatty acids and soapsStool microscopy can evaluate for fecal leukocytes (hallmark of inflammatory diarrhea)Microscopic evaluation for increased muscle fibers (> 10 fibers per HPF, stained with solution of eosin in 10% ethanol) can be performed in cases of suspected malabsorption or hypermotilityLeukocytes can be quantitated using methylene blue stain via 200-cell differentialOther markers of fecal leukocytes include lactoferrin and calprotectinStool pHNormally close to 7; may be lowered by fermentation of sugars in colon by colonic floraFecal pH < 5.3 is characteristic for diarrhea caused by carbohydrate malabsorptionFecal pH > 5.6 argues against carbohydrate malabsorption as cause of diarrheaStool ElectrolytesNormally, stool water is electroneutral, equivalent to osmolality of plasma (280-290 mOsm/kg)Low stool osmolality (< 290 mosmol/kg) suggests contamination of stool with dilute urine, water, or excess ingestion of hypotonic fluidFecal sodium and potassium are measured after homogenization and centrifugation of specimenFecal electrolytes can help distinguish osmotic and secretory diarrhea by calculation of fecal osmotic gapFecal osmotic gap estimation formula: 290 − 2 × [(Na+) + (K+)]Osmotic diarrhea produces stool with low levels of electrolytes, with osmotic gap > 50-75 mOsm/kgElevated stool osmotic gap with stool water pH < 5 indicates disaccharidase deficiencyThis formula should be used to determine osmotic gap rather than using measured fecal osmolality, which can be affected by in vitro bacterial fermentationSecretory diarrhea produces stool isoosmolar with plasma, and so leads to osmotic gap of stool < 50 mOsm/kg; may have associated serum hypokalemia and acidosisSoluble fecal Mg concentration > 45 mmol/L suggests Mg-induced diarrheaFecal FatSteatorrhea: Presence of increased fecal fat output due to malabsorptionQuantitative fecal fat measurement for 48 or 72 hours (van de Kamer method) is gold standard for diagnosis, but has many limitationsAlthough upper limit of normal is 7 g/24 hours, fecal fat values ranging from 7-14 g/24 hours have low specificity for diagnosisFecal fat output > 14 g/24 hours is more predictive of malabsorptionOther limitations include issues with collection, dietary fat control, and lack of quality-control proceduresFecal fat concentration (g fecal fat/100 g wet stool weight) can be used to estimate total fat excretionSpot stool tests via lipophilic stains (Sudan) can be used to microscopically evaluate stool fatAlternative methods include breath tests (e.g., 14C triolein test, which measures breath excretion of 14CO2 after fat meal containing 5 μCi 14C-triolein)Sensitivities of 85-100% have been reported with specificity > 90% using fat load of ~ 20 gThis 14C triolein test is

pancreatic and nonpancreatic originFecal elastase level < 100 μg/g is consistent with severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, with 73-100% sensitivity for severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiencyFecal elastase has lower sensitivity for mild or moderate forms of exocrine pancreatic insufficiencyTesting for fecal elastase is unaffected by pancreatic enzyme replacement therapyFecal chymotrypsin has lower sensitivity for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and is affected by pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, and so is no longer routinely usedBile Acid Malabsorption TestingBile

nutrient absorptionSteatorrhea: Presence of pale, bulky, and foul-smelling stools with high fat content (> 14 g per day), resulting from malabsorption, which may be caused by small intestinal mucosal disease, insufficient bile acid concentration, small-bowel bacterial overgrowth, or pancreatic exocrine insufficiencyLaboratory DiagnosisLow fecal pH (< 5.3) is characteristic for diarrhea caused by carbohydrate malabsorption, whereas fecal pH > 5.6 argues against carbohydrate malabsorption as cause of diarrheaOsmotic diarrhea produces stool with low levels of electrolytes, with osmotic gap > 50-75 mOsm/kgSecretory diarrhea produces stool isoosmolar with plasma, and so leads to osmotic gap of stool < 50 mOsm/kg; may have associated serum hypokalemia and acidosisFecal immunochemical test detects globin component of hemoglobin rather than heme component, and so is more sensitive and specific than stool guaiac testingCLINICAL CORRELATESPathophysiologyMajority of water and electrolytes are absorbed in small intestines, with net amount of 800-1,000 mL of fluid entering colonAbsorption of nutrients and water across small intestinal mucosa is driven by active transport of ions (principally Na+, Cl−, and HCO3−) via membrane-associated channels, endocytic uptake, and paracellular channelsNormal nutrient absorptionRequires processing at luminal and brush border, absorption into intestinal mucosa, and transport into circulationMalabsorptionPathologic state of impaired nutrient absorption in gastrointestinal (GI) tract and can result from disruption of any step involved in nutrient absorptionDiarrheaCharacterized by reduced stool consistency due to incomplete absorption of water and electrolytes by intestineMay result from variety of processes, including altered electrolyte absorption or secretion, as well as presence of osmotically active substances that accumulate in intestinal lumenChronic diarrhea = passage of loose stools for > 4 weeksCauses of chronic diarrhea can be classified as inflammatory, osmotic, secretory, iatrogenic, disrupted motility, and functional diseaseInflammatory diarrhea [e.g., inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)]Presents with malabsorption or rectal bleeding and may be accompanied by other symptoms, such as mucus and blood in stool, abdominal pain, or extraintestinal symptoms involving skin, eyes, and jointsIn ulcerative colitis, main pathogenesis of diarrhea is decrease in net absorption of sodium, chloride, and water from lumen of colonOsmotic diarrheaOccurs when osmotically active substances draw fluid from plasma into jejunumMay result from bacterial overgrowth, osmotic laxatives, disaccharidase deficiency, or pancreatic exocrine insufficiencySecretory diarrheaResults from secretion of isoosmolar fluid, leading to hypokalemia and acidosisMay result from disease states such as VIPoma or congenital chloridorrheaIatrogenic diarrheaMotility disordersCan result in diarrhea by overwhelming reabsorptive capacity of colon in cases of rapid transit disorders or slow transit disorders (such as bacterial overgrowth, which leads to bile acid deconjugation, poor micelle formation, and steatorrhea)Altered gut motility can be associated with variety of disease conditions, including postsurgical states, carcinoid syndromes, diabetes, or infiltrative small bowel diseaseFunctional diseaseFunctional disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, can also lead to diarrheaSteatorrheaPresence of pale, bulky, and foul-smelling stools with high fat content resulting from malabsorptionMay result from small intestinal mucosal disease, insufficient bile acid concentration, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, or pancreatic exocrine insufficiencyBile acids are required for absorption of dietary fats and sterols from intestinePancreatic exocrine insufficiency is most common cause of severe steatorrhea90% of pancreatic acinar tissue must be destroyed before patient develops symptomatic pancreatic exocrine insufficiencyMilder forms of steatorrhea can occur with mucosal or structural diseaseCarbohydrate malabsorptionUsually results from mucosal disease, and subsequent bacterial metabolism of carbohydrates in colon leads to symptoms such as bloating, abdominal cramping, passing of gas, flatulence, and diarrheaLactose intolerance may result from deficiency of intestinal brush border enzyme lactase or small bowel injury (as in Celiac disease, or transiently after acute diarrheal illness)Lactase activity decreases rapidly in most non-white population groups after 2 years of age; a relative lactase deficiency should be regarded as normal in these individualsFructose deficiency can result in similar symptomsLABORATORY DIAGNOSISSpecimen CollectionStool should be collected into bedpan or boiled glass jarInstruct patients not to contaminate outside of container and not to overfill itOverfilling stool containers can result in explosive release of contents due to accumulation of gasGross ExaminationStool with steatorrhea is typically gray and foul-smelling; floats on waterClay-colored stool suggests absence of bile or presence of barium sulfateUpper GI bleeding, bismuth, and iron may cause stool to be blackLower digestive bleeding or beets may cause stool to be redMucus in stool specimens is abnormal and should be reportedFecal CalprotectinCalprotectin: Protein released by activated neutrophils and therefore marker of inflammationCan be used to distinguish inflammatory disorders from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)Sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 94% at 50 µg/gSensitivities and specificities are higher than that of lactoferrin, which is another marker of inflammationFalse-positives can occur with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)MicroscopySudan stains can be used to microscopically evaluate for neutral fats, which appear as large orange or red droplets> 60 droplets per HPF indicates steatorrheaAddition of acetic acid with Sudan staining can evaluate for fatty acids and soaps> 100 droplets per HPF indicates steatorrheaPancreatic disease is more likely to result in steatorrhea with increased fatty acids and soapsStool microscopy can evaluate for fecal leukocytes (hallmark of inflammatory diarrhea)Microscopic evaluation for increased muscle fibers (> 10 fibers per HPF, stained with solution of eosin in 10% ethanol) can be performed in cases of suspected malabsorption or hypermotilityLeukocytes can be quantitated using methylene blue stain via 200-cell differentialOther markers of fecal leukocytes include lactoferrin and calprotectinStool pHNormally close to 7; may be lowered by fermentation of sugars in colon by colonic floraFecal pH < 5.3 is characteristic for diarrhea caused by carbohydrate malabsorptionFecal pH > 5.6 argues against carbohydrate malabsorption as cause of diarrheaStool ElectrolytesNormally, stool water is electroneutral, equivalent to osmolality of plasma (280-290 mOsm/kg)Low stool osmolality (< 290 mosmol/kg) suggests contamination of stool with dilute urine, water, or excess ingestion of hypotonic fluidFecal sodium and potassium are measured after homogenization and centrifugation of specimenFecal electrolytes can help distinguish osmotic and secretory diarrhea by calculation of fecal osmotic gapFecal osmotic gap estimation formula: 290 − 2 × [(Na+) + (K+)]Osmotic diarrhea produces stool with low levels of electrolytes, with osmotic gap > 50-75 mOsm/kgElevated stool osmotic gap with stool water pH < 5 indicates disaccharidase deficiencyThis formula should be used to determine osmotic gap rather than using measured fecal osmolality, which can be affected by in vitro bacterial fermentationSecretory diarrhea produces stool isoosmolar with plasma, and so leads to osmotic gap of stool < 50 mOsm/kg; may have associated serum hypokalemia and acidosisSoluble fecal Mg concentration > 45 mmol/L suggests Mg-induced diarrheaFecal FatSteatorrhea: Presence of increased fecal fat output due to malabsorptionQuantitative fecal fat measurement for 48 or 72 hours (van de Kamer method) is gold standard for diagnosis, but has many limitationsAlthough upper limit of normal is 7 g/24 hours, fecal fat values ranging from 7-14 g/24 hours have low specificity for diagnosisFecal fat output > 14 g/24 hours is more predictive of malabsorptionOther limitations include issues with collection, dietary fat control, and lack of quality-control proceduresFecal fat concentration (g fecal fat/100 g wet stool weight) can be used to estimate total fat excretionSpot stool tests via lipophilic stains (Sudan) can be used to microscopically evaluate stool fatAlternative methods include breath tests (e.g., 14C triolein test, which measures breath excretion of 14CO2 after fat meal containing 5 μCi 14C-triolein)Sensitivities of 85-100% have been reported with specificity > 90% using fat load of ~ 20 gThis 14C triolein test is

pancreatic and nonpancreatic originFecal elastase level < 100 μg/g is consistent with severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, with 73-100% sensitivity for severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiencyFecal elastase has lower sensitivity for mild or moderate forms of exocrine pancreatic insufficiencyTesting for fecal elastase is unaffected by pancreatic enzyme replacement therapyFecal chymotrypsin has lower sensitivity for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and is affected by pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, and so is no longer routinely usedBile Acid Malabsorption TestingBile

          "CLINICAL CORRELATES": "PathophysiologyMajority of water and electrolytes are absorbed in small intestines, with net amount of 800-1,000 mL of fluid entering colonAbsorption of nutrients and water across small intestinal mucosa is driven by active transport of ions (principally Na+, Cl−, and HCO3−) via membrane-associated channels, endocytic uptake, and paracellular channelsNormal nutrient absorptionRequires processing at luminal and brush border, absorption into intestinal mucosa, and transport into circulationMalabsorptionPathologic state of impaired nutrient absorption in gastrointestinal (GI) tract and can result from disruption of any step involved in nutrient absorptionDiarrheaCharacterized by reduced stool consistency due to incomplete absorption of water and electrolytes by intestineMay result from variety of processes, including altered electrolyte absorption or secretion, as well as presence of osmotically active substances that accumulate in intestinal lumenChronic diarrhea = passage of loose stools for > 4 weeksCauses of chronic diarrhea can be classified as inflammatory, osmotic, secretory, iatrogenic, disrupted motility, and functional diseaseInflammatory diarrhea [e.g., inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)]Presents with malabsorption or rectal bleeding and may be accompanied by other symptoms, such as mucus and blood in stool, abdominal pain, or extraintestinal symptoms involving skin, eyes, and jointsIn ulcerative colitis, main pathogenesis of diarrhea is decrease in net absorption of sodium, chloride, and water from lumen of colonOsmotic diarrheaOccurs when osmotically active substances draw fluid from plasma into jejunumMay result from bacterial overgrowth, osmotic laxatives, disaccharidase deficiency, or pancreatic exocrine insufficiencySecretory diarrheaResults from secretion of isoosmolar fluid, leading to hypokalemia and acidosisMay result from disease states such as VIPoma or congenital chloridorrheaIatrogenic diarrheaMotility disordersCan result in diarrhea by overwhelming reabsorptive capacity of colon in cases of rapid transit disorders or slow transit disorders (such as bacterial overgrowth, which leads to bile acid deconjugation, poor micelle formation, and steatorrhea)Altered gut motility can be associated with variety of disease conditions, including postsurgical states, carcinoid syndromes, diabetes, or infiltrative small bowel diseaseFunctional diseaseFunctional disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, can also lead to diarrheaSteatorrheaPresence of pale, bulky, and foul-smelling stools with high fat content resulting from malabsorptionMay result from small intestinal mucosal disease, insufficient bile acid concentration, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, or pancreatic exocrine insufficiencyBile acids are required for absorption of dietary fats and sterols from intestinePancreatic exocrine insufficiency is most common cause of severe steatorrhea90% of pancreatic acinar tissue must be destroyed before patient develops symptomatic pancreatic exocrine insufficiencyMilder forms of steatorrhea can occur with mucosal or structural diseaseCarbohydrate malabsorptionUsually results from mucosal disease, and subsequent bacterial metabolism of carbohydrates in colon leads to symptoms such as bloating, abdominal cramping, passing of gas, flatulence, and diarrheaLactose intolerance may result from deficiency of intestinal brush border enzyme lactase or small bowel injury (as in Celiac disease, or transiently after acute diarrheal illness)Lactase activity decreases rapidly in most non-white population groups after 2 years of age; a relative lactase deficiency should be regarded as normal in these individualsFructose deficiency can result in similar symptoms",
