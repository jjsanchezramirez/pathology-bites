however, no features that allow for determination of antemortem or postmortem are presentPostmortem: Occurring after deathOs coxae: Term used for fused ilium, ischium, and pubisOverviewRole of Forensic AnthropologistAssist with recovery of skeletal remains at scene, whether surface scatter or burialDetermination of human vs. nonhuman remainsDevelopment of biological profile from human skeletal remainsSex of individualAge at time of death of individual, including whether remains are adult or subadultAncestry of individualStature of individualIdentification of trauma, natural disease, morphologic variants, and postmortem changeInvestigationImportant ConsiderationsAnthropologists can assist in identification of clandestine gravesPosition of skeletal remains can provide vital information for investigation (e.g., position body was placed into ground); therefore, just removing remains and sending bones to anthropologist is not best practice, having anthropologist present, if possible, when remains are unearthed is bestAs with position of remains in ground providing information, so can pattern of surface scatter when bones are found above ground, and once again, having anthropologist present for recovery of remains is bestAutopsyDetermination of Human vs. Nonhuman RemainsGeneral considerationsMost common type of bone brought to law enforcement, coroners, medical examiners, or forensic pathologists is nonhuman boneMost nonhuman bones have same name as their human counterpart, with one exception being astragalus, which is nonhuman equivalent of talusMost nonhuman bones have similar structure to their human counterpart, thus serving as potential concern when found by publicAlthough nonhuman bones have similar structure to their human counterpart, some are fused or incompleteIn animals, radius and ulna are often fusedIn animals, fibula is often incomplete with small fragment of proximal fibula present and fused with tibiaBooks and other resources are available (e.g., wildlife education programs at college) for identification of genus and species if so desiredComparison with human skeleton will easily allow for separation of human from nonhumanCommon species encountered by publicDeer, in both urban and rural environmentsMany others, including pigs, bears, dogs, horses, cattle, and birds (e.g., blue herons, chickens)Common nonhuman bones encountered by public and brought to law enforcement or other investigating agencyBear paws, either forepaw or hindpawBear paws are often discarded after processing of bear hide, and these discarded paws can be found by publicDecomposed bear paw closely resembles human hand or footX-ray of bear paw will reveal numerous sesamoid bones (in additional to other differences), which can easily allow for determination that found remains are nonhumanMetapodials, which is generalized term for both metacarpals and metatarsalsAt distal end of metapodial is pulley-like structure with 2 raised ridges for articulation with proximal phalanges; no human bone has similar-appearing structureFemur and tibiaIn deer, in addition to other features, tibial tuberosity projects more than in humans andÂ femoral neck is shorter and less prominent than humansRibs and vertebraeIn deer, vertebrae tend to have longer transverse and spinous processes than humansAtlas and axis are much larger (i.e., less delicate) than in humansRibs from deer are straighter than human ribs, as trunk of animal is directed downwardCalcaneus and astragalusCranium and mandible; however, given characteristic different appearance from human, these bones are rarely brought in by public with concerns that they are humanDevelopment of Biological Profile From Human Skeletal RemainsGeneral considerationsWhen assessing skeletal remains for sex, ancestry, age of individual at time of death, and stature, forensic anthropologist is making estimation as to those featuresWhen using biological profile developed by forensic anthropologist, that individual is different sex or ancestry or of different stature or age at time of death must be always be considered by those using that biological profile in their investigation (e.g., law enforcement)Determination of sex of individualGeneral considerations3 main bones used to determine sex of individual: Os coxae, cranium, and long bones, specifically diameter of femoral &/or humeral headNumerous articles exist for using wide range of other bones to determine sexFeatures of os coxaeConsidered bone that can most accurately estimate sex of individualPhenice criteria for determination of sex from pelvisVentral arc: Present in females, absent in malesIschiopubic ramus: Ridge on medial aspect in females, broad in malesSubpubic concavity: Present in females, absent in malesOther features to help distinguish male from femaleShape of greater sciatic notch: Narrow in females, broad in malesOverall shape of pelvis: Broader in females, narrower in malesPreauricular sulcus: More commonly present in females than malesFeatures of craniumAlthough not as definitive as pelvic traits, cranial traits often allow for accurate estimation of sex5 features to predict sex from craniumNuchal crest (and external occipital protuberance): Well-developed in males, less well-developed in femalesMastoid process: Larger in males, smaller in femalesSupraorbital margin: Thick and rounded in males, thinner and sharp in femalesGlabella: More prominent and projecting forward in males, flatter and less projection forward in femalesMental eminence: Prominent in males, less prominent in femalesComparison of cranium and mandible being examined to reference diagram will assist in assigning score to each of above 5 traits, which will allow for estimation of male vs. femaleFeatures of long bonesFemoral and humeral head diameter can be used to estimate male vs. female sexDetermination of age of individual at time of deathGeneral considerationsDetermination for subadults is based upon physiologic process (i.e., timing of closure of growth plates) and is fairly consistentDetermination for adults is based upon degenerative processes (i.e., wear and tear on bone) and is inconsistentEpiphyseal closure to determine age at time of deathBones are examined for epiphyses and whether they are not fused to diaphysis (i.e., open), partially fused (i.e., partial union), or completely fused (i.e., complete union)Timing of growth plate closure varies throughout body, and because of this variance, numerous locations can be assessed and general age at time of death determinedCompared to determination of age at time of death of adult, examination of skeletal system and assessment of closure of growth plates in subadult provides for relatively accurate assessmentDentition: In subadult, x-rays of maxilla and mandible allows for assessment of eruption of teeth; comparison with standard charts allows for prediction of age at time of death based upon eruption pattern presentFeatures of pubic symphysis to determine age at time of deathOf all methods, assessment of morphologic features of pubic symphysis to estimate age of individual at time of death is considered most reliableSuchey-Brooks and Todd scoring systems are most commonly usedVisual assessment of face of pubic symphysis for billows, development of ventral rampart, dorsal plateau, and superior and inferior extremities is performed to assign pubic symphysis to 1 of 5 stages (Suchey-Brooks) or 1 of 10 stages (Todd); stages have established range for age at time of death associated with eachCollections of casts for comparison are availableFeatures of auricular surface to determine age at time of deathAuricular surface is location at which os coxae articulates with sacrumApex, superior and inferior demiface, and retroauricular area are assessed for billowing, granularity, density, and porosity and assigned to 1 of 8 stages; each stage has age range associated with itFeatures of rib ends to determine age at time of deathEstimation of age at time of death using rib ends is preferably done with 4th ribVisual assessment of articular surface with presence or absence of billowing, depth and shape of pit, and wall of pit with presence or absence of scalloping and presence or absence of bony projections is made and rib assigned to 1 of 8 phases; each phase has age range associated with itFeatures of cranial sutures to determine age at time of deathGenerally considered one of least reliable methods for estimating age at time of deathCranial sutures are assessed as to whether they are open, minimally closed, significantly closed, or obliteratedNumerous locations on ectocranium (vault and lateral-anterior), palate, and, if accessible, endocranium are assessed; each location is assigned score, and total score allows for prediction of age at time of deathDetermination of ancestry of individualGeneral considerationsEstimation of ancestry is most often based upon features of cranium and mandibleEstimation of ancestry can be made both upon morphologic features as well as cranial measurementsFordisc 3.0 is program used by anthropologists to determine ancestry based upon cranial measurementsAncestry of living individual is often at least in part social construct, which is not necessarily representative of their biological structure; thus, assessment of biologic structure for ancestry may lead to erroneous conclusions as to how living individual's ancestry was representedNative Americans share similar morphologic traits with AsiansFeatures of cranium often used for estimation of ancestryNasal bone contour: Varies from low and rounded to steepled with no superior surface plateauLow and rounded nasal bone contour is more frequently associated with individuals of African ancestrySteepled nasal bone contour is more frequently associated with individuals of European ancestryNasal aperture width: Varying from narrow to wideNarrow nasal aperture is more frequently associated with European ancestryWide nasal aperture is more frequently associated with African ancestryAnterior nasal spine: Varies from short to longShort anterior nasal spine is more frequently associated with African ancestryLong anterior nasal spine is more frequently associated with European ancestryInferior nasal margin: Varies from guttered to sillGuttered, or gradual sloping, of inferior nasal margin is more frequently associated with African ancestrySill or prominent ridge between nasal floor and maxilla is more frequently associated with European ancestryNasal overgrowth: Either absent or presentAbsent nasal overgrowth is more frequently associated with European ancestryNasal overgrowthÂ is more frequently associated with African ancestrySupranasal suture: Varies from absent to closed, but can be visible Zygomatic projection: Zygomatic bone is either retreating or projectingRetreating zygomatic bone is more frequently associated with European or African ancestryProjecting zygomatic bone is more frequently associated with Asian ancestryMalar tubercle: Varies from absent to present with incipient and trace as intermediary categoriesAbsent malar tubercle is more frequently associated with African ancestryTrace malar tubercle is more frequently associated with European ancestryInterorbital breadth: Varies from narrow to wideNarrow interorbital breadth is more frequently associated with European ancestryWide interorbital breadth is more frequently associated with African ancestryZygomaxillary suture: Forms include smooth, angled, and S-shapedSmooth zygomaxillary sutureÂ is more frequently associated with African ancestryAngled zygomaxillary sutureÂ is more frequently associated with Asian ancestryS-shaped (or zigzag) zygomaxillary sutureÂ is more frequently associated with European ancestryAlveolar prognathism: Either orthognathic (flat midfacial profile) or prognathic (projecting midfacial profile)Orthognathic is more frequently associated with European or Asian ancestryPrognathic is more frequently associated with European ancestryTransverse palatine suture has several formsStraight and symmetrical: Associated with Asian ancestryAnterior bulging: Associated with African ancestryAnterior and posterior deviation of suture at midline: Associated with European ancestryMandibular torus: Present or absentPresent mandibular torus is more frequently associated with Asian ancestryAbsent mandibular torusÂ is more frequently associated with European or African ancestryPalatine torus: Present or absentPresent palatine torus is more frequently associated with Asian ancestryAbsent mandibular torusÂ is more frequently associated with European or African ancestryPostbregmatic depression: Present or absentPresent postbregmatic depression is more frequently associated with African ancestryAbsent postbregmatic depression is more frequently associated with European or Asian ancestryIn addition to above listed features, other morphologic features that may assist in estimation of ancestry are described in various books and articlesDentition can assist in estimation of ancestry; shoveled incisors are associated with Asian or Native American ancestryDetermination of stature of individualStature determinations are made by measurement of long bone and using that measurement in formula, which is often based upon sex and ancestry of individualFordisc 3.0 will provide stature estimations based upon measurements of long bones entered into programIdentification of TraumaGeneral features in determination of antemortem, perimortem, and postmortem traumaAntemortem trauma is identified by having reaction to trauma (i.e., callus formation, or subsequent evidence of healing of bone)Postmortem trauma often has different coloration of edge of fracture compared to adjacent cortical surface (e.g., when shovel strikes bone that has been in ground, it can break bone and expose white surface of newly exposed bone at fracture line, whereas adjacent cortex, having been exposed to soil for some time, is brown)Perimortem fractures lack features that allow for identification as antemortem or postmortemDistinction between perimortem trauma and postmortem trauma can be very difficultDetermination of perimortem trauma does not indicate that trauma occurred at time of death, only that it occurred around time of deathSome features of antemortem traumaRounded edges and callus formation;Â pseudoarthrosesSome features of postmortem traumaSharp edgesDifferent coloration between fracture edge and adjacent cortical surface of boneSome fracture types (e.g., longitudinal fractures extending along length of bone shaft) are more frequently found postmortem than antemortem or perimortemGeneral fracture conceptsBone is viscoelastic substance, and, as such, responds differently to different forces: When force is applied rapidly, such as gunshot wound, â in stress (force/area) is much greater than â in strain (new length/original length) and bone response is similar to glass and shatters Bone fragments created by gunshot wound can be reapproximated and glued back together into intact bone with its normal shape; when force is applied more slowly, such as blunt force trauma in beating with baseball bat, â in strain is much greater than â in stress and bone response is more like rubber in that bone bends; however, this bending reaches point where it does not reverse (i.e., plastic deformation) and then where it finally breaksWhen bone is broken in this manner (i.e., with plastic deformation) it cannot easily be reapproximated, and when glued back together, shape is not normalDifferent forms of force can act upon bone: Compression, tension, shearing, and bending and rotation, which are combination of first 3In general, bone fails 1st at tension and 2nd at compression (i.e., if rib is bent by placing 2 thumbs against surface and pushing, compression occurs at point of contact with thumbs and tension on opposite side)General classification of fracturesWhile there are numerous names for fractures (over 100 terms used), potentially all fractures of long bones can be described using some basic terms: Extent, integrity of overlying skin, direction of fracture, location of fracture, and alignment of fracture endsExtent: Complete or incompleteIntegrity of overlying skin: Open vs. closed, depending upon intactness of overlying skin, with closed fracture having intact skin and open fracture having lacerated skin (\"simple\" is older term for closed, and \"compound\" is older term for open; these older terms are not preferred)Direction of fracture: Transverse, oblique, spiralLocation of fracture: Epiphyseal, metaphyseal, diaphysealAlignment of fracture ends: Displaced or nondisplacedSpecific types of fracturesIn general, fractures of long bones can be divided into incomplete and completeIncomplete fractures are those which do not involve full-thickness of boneGreenstick fracture: Often involve shaft of bone and are associated with children due to failure of bone at point of tension with maintenance of integrity at point of compressionTorus fracture: Rounded expanse of bone produced by longitudinal compressionDepressed fracture: Involve cranium with failure of outer table of bone but with maintenance of integrity of inner table of boneComplete fractures are those which do involve full-thickness of boneTransverse fracture: Fracture line extends 90Â°Â perpendicular to cortical surfaceOblique fracture: Fracture line extends tangential to cortical surfaceSpiral fracture: Fracture line corkscrews along axis of bone; although spiral fractures have been associated with abuse in children, caution must be used, as accidents can also produce spiral fracturesComminuted fracture: Fracture characterized by multiple fragments of boneSegmental fracture: 2 fracture lines occur on same bone at separate locations, resulting in segment of bone being removed from shaftSome fracture terminology for cranium is different than that for long bonesLinear fracture: Single fracture lineDiastatic fracture: Separation of cranial bones along sutures; these most commonly occur in children but can also occur in adultsDepressed skull fracture and comminuted skull fracture are same as aboveSpecific fractures associated with specific scenariosNumber of eponyms and clinical scenarios used to name fractures is significant; only some mentioned hereColles fracture: Fracture of distal radius due to fall on out-stretched upper extremityRing fracture: Fracture encircling foramen magnum due to fall from height and landing on feet or impact to top of headParryÂ fracture: Fracture of radius or ulna, associated with self-defense against attacker and raising forearm to ward off blowBoxer's fracture: Fracture of 4th or 5th metacarpal, associated with striking another person with fistMetaphyseal fracture (also called chip or bucket handle fracture): Associated with child abuseIdentification of Natural DiseaseCommon natural diseases encountered by forensic anthropologists include osteoporosis, Paget disease, osteoarthritis, and osteomyelitisOsteoporosisMorphology: Cut section of bone would reveal loss of bony trabeculae, resulting in decreased density of boneAssociations: Senility, postmenopausal, endocrine disorders (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, Cushing disease)Complications: Fractures, compression fractures of vertebrae, which can in turn lead to kyphoscoliosis or lumbar lordosisPaget diseaseMorphology: Thickened bone, which upon microscopic examination has mosaic patternComplications: Risk for fracture and can also create impingement at nerve and vessel foramina in craniumOsteoarthritisMorphology: Eburnation of articular surfaces can occur, which appear as smooth, shiny surface of bone, but much more commonly found are osteophytic spurs and new bone growth, often at edges of articular surfaceComplications: If osteophytic spurs connect, fusion can occur, which can result in immobilization at jointIdentification of Morphologic VariantsGeneral considerationsDescription: Morphologic variants are variants in normal anatomy, which can be identified upon examination of skeletal remainsMorphologic variants have been associated with certain ancestral groupsMorphologic variants should not be confused with trauma or natural diseaseCommon morphologic variantsMetopic suture: Suture line extending between bregma, which is intersection of coronal and sagittal sutures and nasion; this suture is between left and right frontal bone and normally closes by 8 years of age; however, it can persist in some individualsSutural bones: Accessory ossicles that appear as island in suture; they can be found at numerous locations but commonly are lambda (intersection of lambdoid sutures and sagittal suture) or bregma or along course of sagittal sutureInca bone: Large bone at apex of occipital bone at lambda, which is due to failure of fusion of ossification centers in occipital bone and is associated with mendosal sutures on endocranial surface, which can be confused with inflicted injury in childMandibular torus: Bony ridge on lingual surface of mandibleSeptal aperture: Perforation of olecranon fossa to coronoid fossa of humerus, which can resemble gunshot woundIdentification of Postmortem ChangeGeneral considerationsPostmortem change can resemble trauma or natural diseasePostmortem change can fall into one of several categories: Weathering, discoloration, cut marks, rodent gnawing or carnivore scavenging, and cultural modificationWeathering produces cracking and splitting of outer surface of boneDiscoloration of bone can occur secondary to deposition in soil, thermal effects, and contact with metal objects; contact with oxidized copper, such as jacket of projectile, can produce light green discoloration of boneCut marks: If partially skeletonized remains need to be dismembered for final removal of soft tissue, careless use of scalpels and other sharp objects can mark skeletal remainsRodent gnawing: Rodents gnaw cortical bone to obtain minerals, including calcium; characteristic appearance are numerous parallel small grooves in bone at surfaceCarnivore scavenging: Carnivores will often chew on proximal and distal ends of long bones to retrieve bone marrow; gnawing can produce round puncture sites in surface of boneAncillary TestingObtaining Material for DNACortical bone and teeth can serve as source for DNACommon bones used are femur (shaft), tibia (shaft), or bones of footWhen taking fragment of shaft for DNA, it is best to not cut entirely through diameter of shaft and instead just cut down to marrow cavity and block out 2 cm or larger segment; this preserves integrity of shaft of bone (i.e., does not divide bone into 2 fragments)ReportingGeneral ConsiderationsReport of skeletal remains should include list of bones present, including their sidedness, estimation of sex, age at time of death, ancestry, and stature as well as identification of trauma (antemortem, perimortem, or postmortem), morphologic variants, natural disease, and postmortem changesAbility to include biological profile will depend upon skeletal remains present; e.g., with complete skeleton, estimation of sex, age at death, ancestry, and stature should be possible; however, if sternum is only bone present, ability to develop complete biological profile will be impaired",

shoveled incisors are associated with Asian or Native American ancestryDetermination of stature of individualStature determinations are made by measurement of long bone and using that measurement in formula, which is often based upon sex and ancestry of individualFordisc 3.0 will provide stature estimations based upon measurements of long bones entered into programIdentification of TraumaGeneral features in determination of antemortem, perimortem, and postmortem traumaAntemortem trauma is identified by having reaction to trauma (i.e., callus formation, or subsequent evidence of healing of bone)Postmortem trauma often has different coloration of edge of fracture compared to adjacent cortical surface (e.g., when shovel strikes bone that has been in ground, it can break bone and expose white surface of newly exposed bone at fracture line, whereas adjacent cortex, having been exposed to soil for some time, is brown)Perimortem fractures lack features that allow for identification as antemortem or postmortemDistinction between perimortem trauma and postmortem trauma can be very difficultDetermination of perimortem trauma does not indicate that trauma occurred at time of death, only that it occurred around time of deathSome features of antemortem traumaRounded edges and callus formation;Â pseudoarthrosesSome features of postmortem traumaSharp edgesDifferent coloration between fracture edge and adjacent cortical surface of boneSome fracture types (e.g., longitudinal fractures extending along length of bone shaft) are more frequently found postmortem than antemortem or perimortemGeneral fracture conceptsBone is viscoelastic substance, and, as such, responds differently to different forces: When force is applied rapidly, such as gunshot wound, â in stress (force/area) is much greater than â in strain (new length/original length) and bone response is similar to glass and shatters Bone fragments created by gunshot wound can be reapproximated and glued back together into intact bone with its normal shape; when force is applied more slowly, such as blunt force trauma in beating with baseball bat, â in strain is much greater than â in stress and bone response is more like rubber in that bone bends; however, this bending reaches point where it does not reverse (i.e., plastic deformation) and then where it finally breaksWhen bone is broken in this manner (i.e., with plastic deformation) it cannot easily be reapproximated, and when glued back together, shape is not normalDifferent forms of force can act upon bone: Compression, tension, shearing, and bending and rotation, which are combination of first 3In general, bone fails 1st at tension and 2nd at compression (i.e., if rib is bent by placing 2 thumbs against surface and pushing, compression occurs at point of contact with thumbs and tension on opposite side)General classification of fracturesWhile there are numerous names for fractures (over 100 terms used), potentially all fractures of long bones can be described using some basic terms: Extent, integrity of overlying skin, direction of fracture, location of fracture, and alignment of fracture endsExtent: Complete or incompleteIntegrity of overlying skin: Open vs. closed, depending upon intactness of overlying skin, with closed fracture having intact skin and open fracture having lacerated skin (\"simple\" is older term for closed, and \"compound\" is older term for open; these older terms are not preferred)Direction of fracture: Transverse, oblique, spiralLocation of fracture: Epiphyseal, metaphyseal, diaphysealAlignment of fracture ends: Displaced or nondisplacedSpecific types of fracturesIn general, fractures of long bones can be divided into incomplete and completeIncomplete fractures are those which do not involve full-thickness of boneGreenstick fracture: Often involve shaft of bone and are associated with children due to failure of bone at point of tension with maintenance of integrity at point of compressionTorus fracture: Rounded expanse of bone produced by longitudinal compressionDepressed fracture: Involve cranium with failure of outer table of bone but with maintenance of integrity of inner table of boneComplete fractures are those which do involve full-thickness of boneTransverse fracture: Fracture line extends 90Â°Â perpendicular to cortical surfaceOblique fracture: Fracture line extends tangential to cortical surfaceSpiral fracture: Fracture line corkscrews along axis of bone; although spiral fractures have been associated with abuse in children, caution must be used, as accidents can also produce spiral fracturesComminuted fracture: Fracture characterized by multiple fragments of boneSegmental fracture: 2 fracture lines occur on same bone at separate locations, resulting in segment of bone being removed from shaftSome fracture terminology for cranium is different than that for long bonesLinear fracture: Single fracture lineDiastatic fracture: Separation of cranial bones along sutures; these most commonly occur in children but can also occur in adultsDepressed skull fracture and comminuted skull fracture are same as aboveSpecific fractures associated with specific scenariosNumber of eponyms and clinical scenarios used to name fractures is significant; only some mentioned hereColles fracture: Fracture of distal radius due to fall on out-stretched upper extremityRing fracture: Fracture encircling foramen magnum due to fall from height and landing on feet or impact to top of headParryÂ fracture: Fracture of radius or ulna, associated with self-defense against attacker and raising forearm to ward off blowBoxer's fracture: Fracture of 4th or 5th metacarpal, associated with striking another person with fistMetaphyseal fracture (also called chip or bucket handle fracture): Associated with child abuseIdentification of Natural DiseaseCommon natural diseases encountered by forensic anthropologists include osteoporosis, Paget disease, osteoarthritis, and osteomyelitisOsteoporosisMorphology: Cut section of bone would reveal loss of bony trabeculae, resulting in decreased density of boneAssociations: Senility, postmenopausal, endocrine disorders (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, Cushing disease)Complications: Fractures, compression fractures of vertebrae, which can in turn lead to kyphoscoliosis or lumbar lordosisPaget diseaseMorphology: Thickened bone, which upon microscopic examination has mosaic patternComplications: Risk for fracture and can also create impingement at nerve and vessel foramina in craniumOsteoarthritisMorphology: Eburnation of articular surfaces can occur, which appear as smooth, shiny surface of bone, but much more commonly found are osteophytic spurs and new bone growth, often at edges of articular surfaceComplications: If osteophytic spurs connect, fusion can occur, which can result in immobilization at jointIdentification of Morphologic VariantsGeneral considerationsDescription: Morphologic variants are variants in normal anatomy, which can be identified upon examination of skeletal remainsMorphologic variants have been associated with certain ancestral groupsMorphologic variants should not be confused with trauma or natural diseaseCommon morphologic variantsMetopic suture: Suture line extending between bregma, which is intersection of coronal and sagittal sutures and nasion; this suture is between left and right frontal bone and normally closes by 8 years of age; however, it can persist in some individualsSutural bones: Accessory ossicles that appear as island in suture; they can be found at numerous locations but commonly are lambda (intersection of lambdoid sutures and sagittal suture) or bregma or along course of sagittal sutureInca bone: Large bone at apex of occipital bone at lambda, which is due to failure of fusion of ossification centers in occipital bone and is associated with mendosal sutures on endocranial surface, which can be confused with inflicted injury in childMandibular torus: Bony ridge on lingual surface of mandibleSeptal aperture: Perforation of olecranon fossa to coronoid fossa of humerus, which can resemble gunshot woundIdentification of Postmortem ChangeGeneral considerationsPostmortem change can resemble trauma or natural diseasePostmortem change can fall into one of several categories: Weathering, discoloration, cut marks, rodent gnawing or carnivore scavenging, and cultural modificationWeathering produces cracking and splitting of outer surface of boneDiscoloration of bone can occur secondary to deposition in soil, thermal effects, and contact with metal objects; contact with oxidized copper, such as jacket of projectile, can produce light green discoloration of boneCut marks: If partially skeletonized remains need to be dismembered for final removal of soft tissue, careless use of scalpels and other sharp objects can mark skeletal remainsRodent gnawing: Rodents gnaw cortical bone to obtain minerals, including calcium; characteristic appearance are numerous parallel small grooves in bone at surfaceCarnivore scavenging: Carnivores will often chew on proximal and distal ends of long bones to retrieve bone marrow; gnawing can produce round puncture sites in surface of boneAncillary TestingObtaining Material for DNACortical bone and teeth can serve as source for DNACommon bones used are femur (shaft), tibia (shaft), or bones of footWhen taking fragment of shaft for DNA, it is best to not cut entirely through diameter of shaft and instead just cut down to marrow cavity and block out 2 cm or larger segment; this preserves integrity of shaft of bone (i.e., does not divide bone into 2 fragments)ReportingGeneral ConsiderationsReport of skeletal remains should include list of bones present, including their sidedness, estimation of sex, age at time of death, ancestry, and stature as well as identification of trauma (antemortem, perimortem, or postmortem), morphologic variants, natural disease, and postmortem changesAbility to include biological profile will depend upon skeletal remains present; e.g., with complete skeleton, estimation of sex, age at death, ancestry, and stature should be possible; however, if sternum is only bone present, ability to develop complete biological profile will be impaired"

anatomic findings at autopsyDrownings are diagnosis of exclusionImportant to consider all alternativesRole, if any, of drugs, alcohol, disease, or injuryMany deaths occur during recreational activitiesDrugs, alcohol, fatigue, injury all may contributeComplications and ContributorsConsider factors without laboratory or anatomic findingsHypothermiaCommon component in many water deathsImportant in water temperatures below 70Â°F (21Â°C)Increases with decrease in water temperatureSurvival less than 30 minutes in very cold water: 35Â°F (1Â°C)Factors increasing survival time with hypothermia: Body fat, clothingFactors decreasing survival time with hypothermia: Increased metabolismHyperventilationMost common in snorkeling deathsHyperventilation decreases COâ, reduces reflex breathingCan produce vertigo and unconsciousnessShallow water blackoutOxygen deprivation in shallow water from breath holdingMay be encouraged by coaches, trainers, peer pressureCritical oxygen shortage causing blackouts from breath holding followingHyperventilation and low COâ, usually unintentional from rapid deep breathingPrior repetitive breath holding causing low initial OâUrge to breath is ignored in spirit of competitiveness and desire to win; lowering Oâ provides \"high,\" and breathing urge is ignoredCombination of all of above in competitive situationsDisease, alcohol, and drugsCan strongly contribute to deaths by drowning, diving, or open-air CO deathsJudgment and synergistic effectsIn general, drowning is listed as COD, manner accidental unless disease is catastrophic and not survivable in any environmentAssume inhospitable water environment played role in death, even with significant disease or intoxicationManner of DeathAccidentalMost deaths are accidentalInclude deaths in water with diseases potentially but not universally fatalMyocardial infarctionCerebral vascular accidentSeizuresCardiac arrhythmiaNatural, restricted to catastrophic eventsEvents not survivable in any environmentPontine hemorrhageMyocardial ruptureConsider genetic testing for sudden deaths, particularly in witnessed, unexplained sudden drowning of swimmerNot changing manner but valuable for family health and potential other at-risk family membersHomicide: Uncommon; possible scenarios includeHomicidal drowning (weighting body down, abandonment in ocean away from assistance)Homicide by other means then placement in water to simulate accidental drowningHomicidal drowning then removal from water and concealment to avoid suspicion of drowningSuicideUncommon method of suicideSupporting evidence of note, preparation, intention, prior attempts, mental evaluation, etc."

CONDITIONSAtherosclerotic Cardiovascular DiseaseAtherosclerotic CAD is responsible for majority of cases of sudden cardiac deathCAD is main cause of ischemic heart diseaseInadequate coronary perfusion is related to fixed atherosclerotic occlusions, obstructive luminal thrombi, &/or vasospasmNotable risk factors for development of CAD includeSmokingDiabetes mellitusHypertensionObesityHyperlipidemiaClinically significant atherosclerotic occlusions are frequently identified within proximal aspect of LAD or LCA, or anywhere along RCAFixed occlusions causing < 70% luminal area narrowing are often considered as asymptomaticFixed occlusions causing > 70% luminal area narrowing are often symptomatic with increased cardiac demandFixed occlusions causing > 90% luminal area narrowing may be symptomatic at restGenerally accepted that for single-vessel involvement, lesions with 75% luminal area narrowing can cause sudden cardiac deathMyocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death are frequently result of acute plaque change (i.e., intraluminal thrombus formation upon site of plaque rupture)In cases of acute thrombosis causing sudden cardiac death, majority of underlying atherosclerotic lesions were asymptomatic prior to plaque rupture and thrombus formationAdrenergic stimulation can predispose vulnerable plaques to rupture (intense emotional stress is associated with development of acute MI)Hypertensive Cardiovascular DiseaseMost hypertensive patients have idiopathic (essential) hypertensionSmall percentage of patients have hypertension due to underlying disorders commonly involving kidneys or adrenal glands (e.g., renal artery stenosis or Cushing syndrome) (secondary hypertension)Hypertension is major cause of left ventricular hypertrophyLeft ventricular hypertrophy is commonly defined as > 1.5 cm in thicknessLeft ventricular hypertrophy is associated with development of sudden cardiac deathRisks associated with

hepatosplenomegalyHepatic chronic passive congestionAscitesEdema (lower extremities)Myocardial InfarctionMost frequently due to atherosclerotic CAD (i.e., acute thrombosis of ruptured atherosclerotic plaque)Small percentage of cases due to coronary artery vasospasm or embolic event (e.g., from valve vegetation)Infarcts limited to subendocardial myocardium (i.e., nontransmural) can result from severe coronary artery atherosclerosis (without thrombosis) due to marginal perfusion in setting of increased demand (i.e., tachycardia)Sudden cardiac death in association with acute MI most commonly

bifurcationRisk of rupture proportional to aneurysm sizeHypertension is major risk factor for development of ascending aortic aneurysms Thoracic aneurysms also associated with connective tissue disorders (e.g., Marfan syndrome), bicuspid aortic valves, and tertiary syphilis Aortic DissectionDefined by presence of blood within arterial media (introduced through intimal tear)Instigating intimal tear typically located within ascending aortaDissection through media can occur retrograde (toward heart) or distally (toward abdominal aorta)Historically associated with aortic aneurysm (referred to as dissecting aneurysm); however, aortic dissection can occur in absence of aortic aneurysmMajority of patients are middle-aged men with history of hypertensionAssociated with cocaine

femoral bloodCollect in tube containing sodium or potassium fluoride preservativesGray top tubesFluoride ions act as enzymatic inhibitors to prevent further ethanol production after collectionAs feasible, additional samples (e.g., urine and vitreous) should also be collected and retainedAvoid collecting blood via blind needle sticks into chestVitreous can serve as viable sample sourceAt equilibrium, vitreous:blood ratio is 1.2Equilibrium of vitreous alcohol trails blood alcohol by 1-2 hoursIf vitreous alcohol concentration is < BAC, decedent died during absorptive phaseSkeletal muscle can also be analyzedTesting on embalmed bodies can be accomplished with vitreous or muscle samplesReportingToxicology InterpretationWhile qualitative measurements of ethanol in postmortem samples is simple to obtain, interpretation of those results requires consideration ofCondition of bodyInterval between death and autopsyEnvironmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity)Nature of analyzed specimenEthanol can be produced within body after deathBacterial fermentation of glucose during decompositionTypical levels produced during decomposition are < 0.07g/dL; in rare cases, has been reported to reach 0.1-0.2 g/dLPostmortem diffusion of alcohol from stomach to central blood has been reported in association with bouts of heavy drinkingPlasma/serum to whole blood ratios are reported as 1.10-1.35 (average 1.18)Concentrations measured in whole blood are < that in plasma/serum, as whole blood contains less water than does plasma/serum, and alcohol distributes uniformly according to body waterDuring absorptive phase, arterial blood may have 40% higher alcohol concentration than venous blood (this difference is not present during postabsorptive phase)Urine alcohol concentrations not useful for estimating BACAlcohol concentrations must be interpreted in context of additional drugs/medications with synergistic effects (e.g., benzodiazepines, opiates, etc.)Death

and breathPhysiologic EffectsEthanol has depressive effects upon CNSAlcohol is GABA agonist (thus has neuroinhibitory effect)Ethanol is vasodilatorAt lower concentrations, ethanol impairsVisual acuityAttention and reaction response timesSensory-motor coordinationJudgmentProgressive impairment additionally includesDrowsinessDisorientationEmotional labilityProfound impairment culminates withStuporUnconsciousnessComaDeathToxicityClinical toxic effects of ethanol are related to CNS depression Inexperienced drinkers are more susceptible to physiologic effects of ethanol than experienced drinkersSevere respiratory &/or CNS depression is generally reported to occur at/around 0.35 g/dLDeath resulting from acute alcohol intoxicationIs generally reported to occur at/around 0.4 g/dLChronic alcoholics may survive concentrations as high as 0.7 g/dLIf individual suffers irreversible cerebral hypoxic insult, may survive for several hours, and BAC may be lower than expected (due to continued metabolism while comatose)Alcohol use can precipitate ketoacidosis (i.e., alcoholic ketoacidosis)Proposed to arise from binge drinking followed by not eatingKetone bodies are produced (e.g., acetone, acetoacetate, and Î²-hydroxybutyrate)Chronic DiseaseDeaths from chronic effects of alcohol far outnumber those from acute intoxicationsPathologic consequences of chronic alcohol abuse includeHepatic cirrhosisHepatic steatosisSteatohepatitisEsophageal &/or anorectal varices (with risk for hemorrhage)PancreatitisDilated cardiomyopathyIncreased risk for cancerWernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is result of thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiencyWernicke encephalopathy is characterized byConfusionOphthalmoplegiaAtaxiaKorsakoff syndrome is disorder of long-term memory (i.e., retrograde amnesia)Alcohol WithdrawalIn dependent users, abrupt cessation of alcohol intake leads to brain hyperexcitability Mild withdrawal symptoms may begin even when user has measurable amount of alcohol in system or up to 12 hours after drinking cessationAnxietyIrritability AgitationTremorsInsomniaNausea/vomitingSweatingTachycardia Hallucinations (auditory, visual, or tactile) may begin 12-24 hours after last drink and usually resolve by 48 hoursWithdrawal seizures (generalized tonic-clonic) typically occur 24-48 hours after last alcohol useDTs are rare complication of withdrawal; symptoms occur 12-72 hours after last drinkHallucinationsDisorientation Confusion and agitationTachycardia and hypertension Constitutes a medical emergencyReported mortality rates up to 5%Investigative ConsiderationsGeneral ConsiderationsPresence of alcohol/alcohol containers is important consideration at any sceneMust also be cognizant of alternative alcohol sources (e.g., empty bottles of mouthwash or cold/cough syrup) Alcohol is frequent contributing factor in motor vehicle crash incidentsAlcohol use history should be obtained from family/friends as appropriate With chronic abusers, absence of alcohol at scene may be only indication of withdrawal With acute intoxication, decedents may roll/fall into compromising positions while unconsciousPositional asphyxia Position of decedents should be documented with thorough photography Presence of dark brown granular blood (\"coffee-ground emesis\") may indicate acute gastrointestinal hemorrhagic eventAcute gastrointestinal hemorrhage can produce large quantities of expelled bloodQuantity of blood on decedent and at scene may mimic traumatic event Autopsy FindingsAcute Intoxication Potential findings are nonspecificPulmonary congestion and edemaGastric mucosal injuryHepatic steatosisDistended bladderAspiration of vomitus Individuals dying from acute intoxication may show disease processes associated with chronic abuse (e.g., cirrhosis, dilated cardiomyopathy, etc.)Acute Withdrawal\nDiagnosis is largely dependent on scene findings, investigation, and toxicology resultsNonspecific autopsy findings might include Dehydration pattern of electrolytes on vitreous chemistryIntramuscular hemorrhage of tongue (from seizure activity)Chronic UseChronic alcohol use is associated with wide variety of disease processes, includingHepatic cirrhosis May be associated with jaundice or scleral icterusEsophageal varices May be associated with acute gastrointestinal hemorrhagePancreatitis (acute or chronic)Dilated cardiomyopathy Cerebellar vermal atrophyAcute Wernicke encephalopathy manifest as mammillary body hemorrhageAncillary TestingToxicologyAntemortem specimens are preferable over postmortem when availableOptimal sample site is femoral bloodCollect in tube containing sodium or potassium fluoride preservativesGray top tubesFluoride ions act as enzymatic inhibitors to prevent further ethanol production after collectionAs feasible, additional samples (e.g., urine and vitreous) should also be collected and retainedAvoid collecting blood via blind needle sticks into chestVitreous can serve as viable sample sourceAt equilibrium, vitreous:blood ratio is 1.2Equilibrium of vitreous alcohol trails blood alcohol by 1-2 hoursIf vitreous alcohol concentration is < BAC, decedent died during absorptive phaseSkeletal muscle can also be analyzedTesting on embalmed bodies can be accomplished with vitreous or muscle samplesReportingToxicology InterpretationWhile qualitative measurements of ethanol in postmortem samples is simple to obtain, interpretation of those results requires consideration ofCondition of bodyInterval between death and autopsyEnvironmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity)Nature of analyzed specimenEthanol can be produced within body after deathBacterial fermentation of glucose during decompositionTypical levels produced during decomposition are < 0.07g/dL; in rare cases, has been reported to reach 0.1-0.2 g/dLPostmortem diffusion of alcohol from stomach to central blood has been reported in association with bouts of heavy drinkingPlasma/serum to whole blood ratios are reported as 1.10-1.35 (average 1.18)Concentrations measured in whole blood are < that in plasma/serum, as whole blood contains less water than does plasma/serum, and alcohol distributes uniformly according to body waterDuring absorptive phase, arterial blood may have 40% higher alcohol concentration than venous blood (this difference is not present during postabsorptive phase)Urine alcohol concentrations not useful for estimating BACAlcohol concentrations must be interpreted in context of additional drugs/medications with synergistic effects (e.g., benzodiazepines, opiates, etc.)Death from acute alcohol intoxication is routinely classified as accidentDeath from chronic alcohol abuse is routinely classified as natural"

naturally occurring chemical found in opium (e.g., morphine, codeine, thebaine)Opioid is synthetic or manufactured drug resembling or mimicking effects of opiatesSemisynthetic opioids are those opioids derived from naturally occurring opiates (e.g., heroin, oxycodone, and hydrocodone)Synthetic opioids are those opioids derived in laboratory, not from opium poppy (e.g., methadone and fentanyl)Narcotic is derived from Greek narkotikon, meaning \"to be numb\"Morphine is derived from Morpheus, Greek god of dreamsOVERVIEWSource of Heroin and MorphineOpiates are derived from Papaver somniforum plant, commonly known as opium poppyRaw opium was only known analgesic in early recorded historyNaturally occurring opiates derived from poppy resin (opium) includeMorphineMost prevalent opium alkaloid (opium contains 10-16% morphine)Poppy seeds may contain morphine at concentrations of 4-200 mg/kgCan be used as drug, or for production of semisynthetic opioidsHeroin (diacetylmorphine) is synthesized from morphineCodeine, while naturally occurring in opium, is also commonly synthesized from morphineCodeineMinor component of opium (opium contains 0.5% codeine)Used as analgesic, cough suppressantThebaineUsed for synthesis of semisynthetic opioids (e.g., oxycodone and hydrocodone)Regions of prominent opium production include Mexico, Southeast Asia, Southwest Asia, and South AmericaRoutes of AdministrationMorphine is availableIn liquid preparations (for either oral ingestion or injection)As tablet or capsuleAs suppositoryHeroin is availableAs powder (white or black)As black tar-like substanceHeroin may be injected, smoked, or snortedCLINICAL ISSUESMetabolism of MorphineMorphine has t1/2 of 2-3 hoursMajority of administered morphine is converted in liver to inactive metabolite, morphine-3-glucoronideMorphine-6-glucuronide is active metaboliteMetabolism of Heroint1/2Heroin: 2-6 minutes6-MAM: 6-40 minutesMorphine: 2-3 hoursHeroin is rapidly deacetylated in blood (by blood esterases) to 6-MAM6-MAM is further hydrolyzed to morphine (presumably in liver)Physiologic EffectsOpiates and opioids act upon opioid receptors in brainNotably Î¼ receptorEndogenous activators of opioid receptors include endorphinsMorphine and heroin act asCNS depressantsAnalgesicsIn brain tissue, heroin has very little affinity for opioid receptorsNarcotic activity of heroin is attributed to 6-MAM and morphineModerate doses of morphine or heroin produceEuphoriaConstricted (pinpoint) pupilsNauseaConstipationHigher doses may produceDrowsiness, sedation, or comaRespiratory

AD 130-210)Best known for his systemization and innovation of Hippocratic medical traditionStudied anatomy principally through dissection and vivisection of animals (pigs and apes)Credited as 1st to correlate patient complaints and symptoms with what was found upon examination of affected area of deceasedHis written masterpiece, On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body, was based on humoral

historyPhysician Antistius offered opinion that of 23 stab wounds, none were fatal except for wound to breastAntistius' report gave rise to Latin term forensics, meaning \"before the forum\" (where Antistius delivered his opinion)Justinian enactments (529-564)Provided for regulation of practice of medicineRequired proof of competence by means of examinationImposed penalties for

at any time during pregnancyIf occurring after predetermined time (commonly 20 weeks gestational age), then also referred to as stillbirthIf occurring before predetermined time (commonly 20 weeks gestational age), then also referred to as spontaneous abortionState laws regulate reporting of fetal deaths to Health Department/Office of Vital StatisticsPurpose of reporting is for generation and completion of fetal death certificate (stillbirth certificate)Can be completed by attending physician, if death is not under investigation by ME/CState-by-state listing of reporting requirements for fetal deaths is available through CDCMany states require reporting of fetal deathsAt 350 grams birthweightAt 20 weeks gestational age, if weight is unknownFew states require reporting for all gestational agesAdditional state statutes regulate reporting of fetal deaths to ME/C officeFetal deaths meeting requirements for reporting to Health Department/Office of Vital Statistics do not

alterations in consciousness, orientation, memory, thought, and behaviorExcited delirium is delirium characterized by agitation, aggressive or violent behaviorExcited delirium syndrome is sudden death of person following period of excited delirium for which autopsy does not disclose evidence of sufficient trauma or natural disease to otherwise explain deathOVERVIEWGeneral ConsiderationsDelirium is state of acute disturbance in cognition and consciousnessGeneral features includeDisorientation to space and timeDisorganized thought processesDisorganized speechHallucinationsExcited delirium is delirium involving violent behaviorExcited delirium was first described as Bell mania by Dr. Luther Bell in 1849Potentially fatal form of delirium in mentally ill patientsPatients presented withÂ fever, agitation, and inability to sleepViolent behaviors often necessitated physical restraintSymptoms persisted over chronic course (days to months), with death usually occurring after several weeks Reports of fatal cases of Bell mania dissipated in 1950s with introduction of phenothiazinesAcute form of excited delirium was described in 1980s in association with illicit stimulants (e.g., cocaine and methamphetamine)Follows characteristic sequence of eventsDelirium with agitation (e.g., fear, panic, and violent, bizarre, or hyperactive behaviors)Struggle with physical restraintSudden cessation of struggleCardiorespiratory arrest and deathDiffers from Bell mania in thatCases strongly associated with stimulant drug use Death occurs within minutes to hours of symptom onsetCLINICAL ISSUESCase Presentation In its present form, excited delirium syndrome is strongly associated with abuse of illegal stimulantsMost commonly cocaine or methamphetamineRarely phencyclidine (PCP)Most patients are male, and majority do not have underlying mental illnessCases involving patients with underlying mental illness do occur but are less frequent On initial assessment, it is difficult (if not impossible) to distinguish cases of excited delirium due to stimulant abuse from excited delirium due to mental illnessMajority of cases are associated with displays of unexpected strength &/or hyperthermiaDeath invariably occurs within minutes to hours after struggle with police or medical personnel involving use of physical restraints Excited delirium syndrome is acute condition, in contrast to chronic nature of Bell maniaDeath is characterized by cardiopulmonary arrest resistant to cardiopulmonary resuscitative efforts Mechanism of Disease and DeathExcited delirium syndrome is associated with activation of sympathetic nervous system, notably with elevated levels of dopaminePsychostimulants (e.g., cocaine and methamphetamine) increase synaptic levels of dopamine Chronic cocaine use normally leads to compensatory upregulation in dopamine transporters (which aids to clear excessive dopamine from synapses) It is theorized with excited delirium syndrome, there is failure of upregulation of dopamine transporters, and resultant excessive dopamine signaling (i.e., functional hyperdopaminergia) triggers delirium and precipitates autonomic dysfunctionHyperadrenergic state may then cause cardiac dysrhythmia, accounting for fatal outcomesHypothalamic dopamine receptors control thermoregulation, and thus dopamine dysregulation may further account for profound hyperthermia characteristic of excited delirium Means and nature of physical restraint may alternatively suggest death due to positional or traumatic asphyxia Assertion of positional or traumatic asphyxia must be weighed against known case circumstances and published scientific data regarding practicality of restraint-induced hypoxia INVESTIGATIVE CONSIDERATIONSScene InvestigationsComplete and thorough scene investigation is of paramount importance, to include detailed photographic documentationDiagnosis of excited delirium syndrome is largely dependent on investigative circumstances Police reports, emergency medical service reports, and witness statements should all be collected and reviewed In unwitnessed cases, attempts at self-cooling (placement of cold towels, immersion in water) may signify hyperthermiaHyperthermia is important hallmark of excited delirium syndrome and is regarded as harbinger of death Medical Records Past medical records should be collectedMedication list should be reviewed, with attention to drugs with known cardiotoxic effects (e.g., QT prolongation)Clinical features of excited delirium syndrome includeAcute mental status changeAgitationAdrenergic dysfunctionTachycardiaTachypneaHyperthermia DiaphoresisNoncompliance (with police or medical personnel) Increased pain tolerance and unusual strengthAbundant energy and lack of fatigue If there is cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation and ensuing prolonged survival, patients may also develop RhabdomyolysisAcute renal failureDisseminated intravascular coagulation AUTOPSY FINDINGSGeneral ConsiderationsUseful approach to autopsy in cases of suspected excited delirium syndrome is to identify or exclude other intervening injuries or diseases Reported cases of excited delirium syndrome are often associated with significant natural disease (e.g., atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease) that is felt to be contributory to death by making individuals more susceptible to fatal cardiac dysrhythmiaIn other instances, autopsy findings may be minimal External Examination By definition, discovered injuries (e.g., abrasions, contusions) are minorDocument with photography to include pertinent negative findings Internal Examination Complete autopsy should be performed Perform anterior neck dissectionCut-downs of torso and extremities should be considered ANCILLARY TESTINGToxicologyToxicology testing is fundamental step in evaluation of excited delirium syndromeRequest and analyze hospital admission blood samples, if applicable and available Samples should be collected from multiples sources (e.g., peripheral blood, vitreous, urine, &/or bile)Vast majority of cases of excited delirium syndrome will be positive for illicit stimulants, either cocaine or methamphetamine Other reported drugs include PCP, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), cathinones (bath salts), and prescription psychiatric medicationsHistologyHistologic evaluation of organs is important step in properly excluding presence of natural diseaseSample and evaluate cardiac conduction system (e.g., sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes)OtherConsider retention of brain or brain slices, and neuropathology consultation, depending on individual case circumstancesConsider genetic testing for conduction system abnormalities, depending on individual case circumstances Elevations in levels of brain heat shock proteins [i.e., heat shock protein 70 (hsp70)] have been reportedBiomarker of hyperthermiaREPORTINGDeath CertificationDeterminations of cause and manner of death in cases of suspected excited delirium syndrome may have implications regarding allegations of police misconduct or brutality Due to common negative findings (i.e., lack of identifiable injuries), allegations of \"cover-ups\" are not infrequent Rulings should not be issued until ancillary testing has been completed, and all pertinent records have been collected and reviewedDue consideration must be given to alternative intervening causes (e.g., neck or chest compression, blunt force injuries, or significant natural disease) Cause of death statements may be descriptive (e.g., \"cardiac dysrhythmia complicating struggle with physical restraint in a person under the influence of methamphetamine\") Given contribution of physical struggle, manner of death is best classified as either homicide or

        "raw_text": "KEY FACTSOVERVIEWAnthropologists can provide very useful information to death investigation based upon examination of bones in situ, whether surface scatter or burialWhen unidentified bone is found by public, most often that bone is nonhumanMost nonhuman bone can easily be distinguished from human bone by gross examination and comparison with normal human anatomyWith shaft fragments, microscopic examination may be necessaryBased upon examination of skeletal remains, anthropologists can form biological profile, which includes estimation of sex, age at time of death, ancestry, and stature of individual Accuracy and completeness of biological profile will depend upon specific bone(s) available for examinationOs coxae is considered bone that can most accurately estimate sex of individualAUTOPSYAnthropologists can assist forensic pathologist with assessment of skeletal traumaAnthropologists can assess skeletal remains for morphologic variants, postmortem changes, and natural disease, each of which could potentially be confused with traumaPostmortem changes can resemble trauma or natural diseaseExamples include weathering, discoloration, cut marks, rodent gnawing or carnivore scavenging, and cultural modification ANCILLARY TESTINGCommon bones used are femur, tibia, or bones of feetBones and teeth can serve as source for DNATERMINOLOGYDefinitionsAncestry: Preferred term instead of race, identifying whether individual is White, Black, Native American, or Asian, most commonlyAntemortem: Occurring prior to deathPerimortem: Occurring around time of death, may be at time of death, or prior to time of death, or after time of death; however, no features that allow for determination of antemortem or postmortem are presentPostmortem: Occurring after deathOs coxae: Term used for fused ilium, ischium, and pubisOverviewRole of Forensic AnthropologistAssist with recovery of skeletal remains at scene, whether surface scatter or burialDetermination of human vs. nonhuman remainsDevelopment of biological profile from human skeletal remainsSex of individualAge at time of death of individual, including whether remains are adult or subadultAncestry of individualStature of individualIdentification of trauma, natural disease, morphologic variants, and postmortem changeInvestigationImportant ConsiderationsAnthropologists can assist in identification of clandestine gravesPosition of skeletal remains can provide vital information for investigation (e.g., position body was placed into ground); therefore, just removing remains and sending bones to anthropologist is not best practice, having anthropologist present, if possible, when remains are unearthed is bestAs with position of remains in ground providing information, so can pattern of surface scatter when bones are found above ground, and once again, having anthropologist present for recovery of remains is bestAutopsyDetermination of Human vs. Nonhuman RemainsGeneral considerationsMost common type of bone brought to law enforcement, coroners, medical examiners, or forensic pathologists is nonhuman boneMost nonhuman bones have same name as their human counterpart, with one exception being astragalus, which is nonhuman equivalent of talusMost nonhuman bones have similar structure to their human counterpart, thus serving as potential concern when found by publicAlthough nonhuman bones have similar structure to their human counterpart, some are fused or incompleteIn animals, radius and ulna are often fusedIn animals, fibula is often incomplete with small fragment of proximal fibula present and fused with tibiaBooks and other resources are available (e.g., wildlife education programs at college) for identification of genus and species if so desiredComparison with human skeleton will easily allow for separation of human from nonhumanCommon species encountered by publicDeer, in both urban and rural environmentsMany others, including pigs, bears, dogs, horses, cattle, and birds (e.g., blue herons, chickens)Common nonhuman bones encountered by public and brought to law enforcement or other investigating agencyBear paws, either forepaw or hindpawBear paws are often discarded after processing of bear hide, and these discarded paws can be found by publicDecomposed bear paw closely resembles human hand or footX-ray of bear paw will reveal numerous sesamoid bones (in additional to other differences), which can easily allow for determination that found remains are nonhumanMetapodials, which is generalized term for both metacarpals and metatarsalsAt distal end of metapodial is pulley-like structure with 2 raised ridges for articulation with proximal phalanges;

however, given characteristic different appearance from human, these bones are rarely brought in by public with concerns that they are humanDevelopment of Biological Profile From Human Skeletal RemainsGeneral considerationsWhen assessing skeletal remains for sex, ancestry, age of individual at time of death, and stature, forensic anthropologist is making estimation as to those featuresWhen using biological profile developed by forensic anthropologist, that individual is different sex or ancestry or of different stature or age at time of death must be always be considered by those using that biological profile in their investigation (e.g., law enforcement)Determination of sex of individualGeneral considerations3 main bones used to determine sex of individual: Os coxae, cranium, and long bones, specifically diameter of femoral &/or humeral headNumerous articles exist for using wide range of other bones to determine sexFeatures of os coxaeConsidered bone that can most accurately estimate sex of individualPhenice criteria for determination of sex from pelvisVentral arc: Present in females, absent in malesIschiopubic ramus: Ridge on medial aspect in females, broad in malesSubpubic concavity: Present in females, absent in malesOther features to help distinguish male from femaleShape of greater sciatic notch: Narrow in females, broad in malesOverall shape of pelvis: Broader in females, narrower in malesPreauricular sulcus: More commonly present in females than malesFeatures of craniumAlthough not as definitive as pelvic traits, cranial traits often allow for accurate estimation of sex5 features to predict sex from craniumNuchal crest (and external occipital protuberance): Well-developed in males, less well-developed in femalesMastoid process: Larger in males, smaller in femalesSupraorbital margin: Thick and rounded in males, thinner and sharp in femalesGlabella: More prominent and projecting forward in males, flatter and less projection forward in femalesMental eminence: Prominent in males, less prominent in femalesComparison of cranium and mandible being examined to reference diagram will assist in assigning score to each of above 5 traits, which will allow for estimation of male vs. femaleFeatures of long bonesFemoral and humeral head diameter can be used to estimate male vs. female sexDetermination of age of individual at time of deathGeneral considerationsDetermination for subadults is based upon physiologic process (i.e., timing of closure of growth plates) and is fairly consistentDetermination for adults is based upon degenerative processes (i.e., wear and tear on bone) and is inconsistentEpiphyseal closure to determine age at time of deathBones are examined for epiphyses and whether they are not fused to diaphysis (i.e., open), partially fused (i.e., partial union), or completely fused (i.e., complete union)Timing of growth plate closure varies throughout body, and because of this variance, numerous locations can be assessed and general age at time of death determinedCompared to determination of age at time of death of adult, examination of skeletal system and assessment of closure of growth plates in subadult provides for relatively accurate assessmentDentition: In subadult, x-rays of maxilla and mandible allows for assessment of eruption of teeth; comparison with standard charts allows for prediction of age at time of death based upon eruption pattern presentFeatures of pubic symphysis to determine age at time of deathOf all methods, assessment of morphologic features of pubic symphysis to estimate age of individual at time of death is considered most reliableSuchey-Brooks and Todd scoring systems are most commonly usedVisual assessment of face of pubic symphysis for billows, development of ventral rampart, dorsal plateau, and superior and inferior extremities is performed to assign pubic symphysis to 1 of 5 stages (Suchey-Brooks) or 1 of 10 stages (Todd); stages have established range for age at time of death associated with eachCollections of casts for comparison are availableFeatures of auricular surface to determine age at time of deathAuricular surface is location at which os coxae articulates with sacrumApex, superior and inferior demiface, and retroauricular area are assessed for billowing, granularity, density, and porosity and assigned to 1 of 8 stages; each stage has age range associated with itFeatures of rib ends to determine age at time of deathEstimation of age at time of death using rib ends is preferably done with 4th ribVisual assessment of articular surface with presence or absence of billowing, depth and shape of pit, and wall of pit with presence or absence of scalloping and presence or absence of bony projections is made and rib assigned to 1 of 8 phases; each phase has age range associated with itFeatures of cranial sutures to determine age at time of deathGenerally considered one of least reliable methods for estimating age at time of deathCranial sutures are assessed as to whether they are open, minimally closed, significantly closed, or obliteratedNumerous locations on ectocranium (vault and lateral-anterior), palate, and, if accessible, endocranium are assessed; each location is assigned score, and total score allows for prediction of age at time of deathDetermination of ancestry of individualGeneral considerationsEstimation of ancestry is most often based upon features of cranium and mandibleEstimation of ancestry can be made both upon morphologic features as well as cranial measurementsFordisc 3.0 is program used by anthropologists to determine ancestry based upon cranial measurementsAncestry of living individual is often at least in part social construct, which is not necessarily representative of their biological structure; thus, assessment of biologic structure for ancestry may lead to erroneous conclusions as to how living individual's ancestry was representedNative Americans share similar morphologic traits with AsiansFeatures of cranium often used for estimation of ancestryNasal bone contour: Varies from low and rounded to steepled with no superior surface plateauLow and rounded nasal bone contour is more frequently associated with individuals of African ancestrySteepled nasal bone contour is more frequently associated with individuals of European ancestryNasal aperture width: Varying from narrow to wideNarrow nasal aperture is more frequently associated with European ancestryWide nasal aperture is more frequently associated with African ancestryAnterior nasal spine: Varies from short to longShort anterior nasal spine is more frequently associated with African ancestryLong anterior nasal spine is more frequently associated with European ancestryInferior nasal margin: Varies from guttered to sillGuttered, or gradual sloping, of inferior nasal margin is more frequently associated with African ancestrySill or prominent ridge between nasal floor and maxilla is more frequently associated with European ancestryNasal overgrowth: Either absent or presentAbsent nasal overgrowth is more frequently associated with European ancestryNasal overgrowthÂ is more frequently associated with African ancestrySupranasal suture: Varies from absent to closed, but can be visible Zygomatic projection: Zygomatic bone is either retreating or projectingRetreating zygomatic bone is more frequently associated with European or African ancestryProjecting zygomatic bone is more frequently associated with Asian ancestryMalar tubercle: Varies from absent to present with incipient and trace as intermediary categoriesAbsent malar tubercle is more frequently associated with African ancestryTrace malar tubercle is more frequently associated with European ancestryInterorbital breadth: Varies from narrow to wideNarrow interorbital breadth is more frequently associated with European ancestryWide interorbital breadth is more frequently associated with African ancestryZygomaxillary suture: Forms include smooth, angled, and S-shapedSmooth zygomaxillary sutureÂ is more frequently associated with African ancestryAngled zygomaxillary sutureÂ is more frequently associated with Asian ancestryS-shaped (or zigzag) zygomaxillary sutureÂ is more frequently associated with European ancestryAlveolar prognathism: Either orthognathic (flat midfacial profile) or prognathic (projecting midfacial profile)Orthognathic is more frequently associated with European or Asian ancestryPrognathic is more frequently associated with European ancestryTransverse palatine suture has several formsStraight and symmetrical: Associated with Asian ancestryAnterior bulging: Associated with African ancestryAnterior and posterior deviation of suture at midline: Associated with European ancestryMandibular torus: Present or absentPresent mandibular torus is more frequently associated with Asian ancestryAbsent mandibular torusÂ is more frequently associated with European or African ancestryPalatine torus: Present or absentPresent palatine torus is more frequently associated with Asian ancestryAbsent mandibular torusÂ is more frequently associated with European or African ancestryPostbregmatic depression: Present or absentPresent postbregmatic depression is more frequently associated with African ancestryAbsent postbregmatic depression is more frequently associated with European or Asian ancestryIn addition to above listed features, other morphologic features that may assist in estimation of ancestry are described in various books and articlesDentition can assist in estimation of ancestry; shoveled incisors are associated with Asian or Native American ancestryDetermination of stature of individualStature determinations are made by measurement of long bone and using that measurement in formula, which is often based upon sex and ancestry of individualFordisc 3.0 will provide stature estimations based upon measurements of long bones entered into programIdentification of TraumaGeneral features in determination of antemortem, perimortem, and postmortem traumaAntemortem trauma is identified by having reaction to trauma (i.e., callus formation, or subsequent evidence of healing of bone)Postmortem trauma often has different coloration of edge of fracture compared to adjacent cortical surface (e.g., when shovel strikes bone that has been in ground, it can break bone and expose white surface of newly exposed bone at fracture line, whereas adjacent cortex, having been exposed to soil for some time, is brown)Perimortem fractures lack features that allow for identification as antemortem or postmortemDistinction between perimortem trauma and postmortem trauma can be very difficultDetermination of perimortem trauma does not indicate that trauma occurred at time of death, only that it occurred around time of deathSome features of antemortem traumaRounded edges and callus formation;Â pseudoarthrosesSome features of postmortem traumaSharp edgesDifferent coloration between fracture edge and adjacent cortical surface of boneSome fracture types (e.g., longitudinal fractures extending along length of bone shaft) are more frequently found postmortem than antemortem or perimortemGeneral fracture conceptsBone is viscoelastic substance, and, as such, responds differently to different forces: When force is applied rapidly, such as gunshot wound, â in stress (force/area) is much greater than â in strain (new length/original length) and bone response is similar to glass and shatters Bone fragments created by gunshot wound can be reapproximated and glued back together into intact bone with its normal shape; when force is applied more slowly, such as blunt force trauma in beating with baseball bat, â in strain is much greater than â in stress and bone response is more like rubber in that bone bends; however, this bending reaches point where it does not reverse (i.e., plastic deformation) and then where it finally breaksWhen bone is broken in this manner (i.e., with plastic deformation) it cannot easily be reapproximated, and when glued back together, shape is not normalDifferent forms of force can act upon bone: Compression, tension, shearing, and bending and rotation, which are combination of first 3In general, bone fails 1st at tension and 2nd at compression (i.e., if rib is bent by placing 2 thumbs against surface and pushing, compression occurs at point of contact with thumbs and tension on opposite side)General classification of fracturesWhile there are numerous names for fractures (over 100 terms used), potentially all fractures of long bones can be described using some basic terms: Extent, integrity of overlying skin, direction of fracture, location of fracture, and alignment of fracture endsExtent: Complete or incompleteIntegrity of overlying skin: Open vs. closed, depending upon intactness of overlying skin, with closed fracture having intact skin and open fracture having lacerated skin (\"simple\" is older term for closed, and \"compound\" is older term for open; these older terms are not preferred)Direction of fracture: Transverse, oblique, spiralLocation of fracture: Epiphyseal, metaphyseal, diaphysealAlignment of fracture ends: Displaced or nondisplacedSpecific types of fracturesIn general, fractures of long bones can be divided into incomplete and completeIncomplete fractures are those which do not involve full-thickness of boneGreenstick fracture: Often involve shaft of bone and are associated with children due to failure of bone at point of tension with maintenance of integrity at point of compressionTorus fracture: Rounded expanse of bone produced by longitudinal compressionDepressed fracture: Involve cranium with failure of outer table of bone but with maintenance of integrity of inner table of boneComplete fractures are those which do involve full-thickness of boneTransverse fracture: Fracture line extends 90Â°Â perpendicular to cortical surfaceOblique fracture: Fracture line extends tangential to cortical surfaceSpiral fracture: Fracture line corkscrews along axis of bone; although spiral fractures have been associated with abuse in children, caution must be used, as accidents can also produce spiral fracturesComminuted fracture: Fracture characterized by multiple fragments of boneSegmental fracture: 2 fracture lines occur on same bone at separate locations, resulting in segment of bone being removed from shaftSome fracture terminology for cranium is different than that for long bonesLinear fracture: Single fracture lineDiastatic fracture: Separation of cranial bones along sutures; these most commonly occur in children but can also occur in adultsDepressed skull fracture and comminuted skull fracture are same as aboveSpecific fractures associated with specific scenariosNumber of eponyms and clinical scenarios used to name fractures is significant; only some mentioned hereColles fracture: Fracture of distal radius due to fall on out-stretched upper extremityRing fracture: Fracture encircling foramen magnum due to fall from height and landing on feet or impact to top of headParryÂ fracture: Fracture of radius or ulna, associated with self-defense against attacker and raising forearm to ward off blowBoxer's fracture: Fracture of 4th or 5th metacarpal, associated with striking another person with fistMetaphyseal fracture (also called chip or bucket handle fracture): Associated with child abuseIdentification of Natural DiseaseCommon natural diseases encountered by forensic anthropologists include osteoporosis, Paget disease, osteoarthritis, and osteomyelitisOsteoporosisMorphology: Cut section of bone would reveal loss of bony trabeculae, resulting in decreased density of boneAssociations: Senility, postmenopausal, endocrine disorders (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, Cushing disease)Complications: Fractures, compression fractures of vertebrae, which can in turn lead to kyphoscoliosis or lumbar lordosisPaget diseaseMorphology: Thickened bone, which upon microscopic examination has mosaic patternComplications: Risk for fracture and can also create impingement at nerve and vessel foramina in craniumOsteoarthritisMorphology: Eburnation of articular surfaces can occur, which appear as smooth, shiny surface of bone, but much more commonly found are osteophytic spurs and new bone growth, often at edges of articular surfaceComplications: If osteophytic spurs connect, fusion can occur, which can result in immobilization at jointIdentification of Morphologic VariantsGeneral considerationsDescription: Morphologic variants are variants in normal anatomy, which can be identified upon examination of skeletal remainsMorphologic variants have been associated with certain ancestral groupsMorphologic variants should not be confused with trauma or natural diseaseCommon morphologic variantsMetopic suture: Suture line extending between bregma, which is intersection of coronal and sagittal sutures and nasion; this suture is between left and right frontal bone and normally closes by 8 years of age; however, it can persist in some individualsSutural bones: Accessory ossicles that appear as island in suture; they can be found at numerous locations but commonly are lambda (intersection of lambdoid sutures and sagittal suture) or bregma or along course of sagittal sutureInca bone: Large bone at apex of occipital bone at lambda, which is due to failure of fusion of ossification centers in occipital bone and is associated with mendosal sutures on endocranial surface, which can be confused with inflicted injury in childMandibular torus: Bony ridge on lingual surface of mandibleSeptal aperture: Perforation of olecranon fossa to coronoid fossa of humerus, which can resemble gunshot woundIdentification of Postmortem ChangeGeneral considerationsPostmortem change can resemble trauma or natural diseasePostmortem change can fall into one of several categories: Weathering, discoloration, cut marks, rodent gnawing or carnivore scavenging, and cultural modificationWeathering produces cracking and splitting of outer surface of boneDiscoloration of bone can occur secondary to deposition in soil, thermal effects, and contact with metal objects; contact with oxidized copper, such as jacket of projectile, can produce light green discoloration of boneCut marks: If partially skeletonized remains need to be dismembered for final removal of soft tissue, careless use of scalpels and other sharp objects can mark skeletal remainsRodent gnawing: Rodents gnaw cortical bone to obtain minerals, including calcium; characteristic appearance are numerous parallel small grooves in bone at surfaceCarnivore scavenging: Carnivores will often chew on proximal and distal ends of long bones to retrieve bone marrow; gnawing can produce round puncture sites in surface of boneAncillary TestingObtaining Material for DNACortical bone and teeth can serve as source for DNACommon bones used are femur (shaft), tibia (shaft), or bones of footWhen taking fragment of shaft for DNA, it is best to not cut entirely through diameter of shaft and instead just cut down to marrow cavity and block out 2 cm or larger segment; this preserves integrity of shaft of bone (i.e., does not divide bone into 2 fragments)ReportingGeneral ConsiderationsReport of skeletal remains should include list of bones present, including their sidedness, estimation of sex, age at time of death, ancestry, and stature as well as identification of trauma (antemortem, perimortem, or postmortem), morphologic variants, natural disease, and postmortem changesAbility to include biological profile will depend upon skeletal remains present; e.g., with complete skeleton, estimation of sex, age at death, ancestry, and stature should be possible; however, if sternum is only bone present, ability to develop complete biological profile will be impaired",

they can be found at numerous locations but commonly are lambda (intersection of lambdoid sutures and sagittal suture) or bregma or along course of sagittal sutureInca bone: Large bone at apex of occipital bone at lambda, which is due to failure of fusion of ossification centers in occipital bone and is associated with mendosal sutures on endocranial surface, which can be confused with inflicted injury in childMandibular torus: Bony ridge on lingual surface of mandibleSeptal aperture: Perforation of olecranon fossa to coronoid fossa of humerus, which can resemble gunshot woundIdentification of Postmortem ChangeGeneral considerationsPostmortem change can resemble trauma or natural diseasePostmortem change can fall into one of several categories: Weathering, discoloration, cut marks, rodent gnawing or carnivore scavenging, and cultural modificationWeathering produces cracking and splitting of outer surface of boneDiscoloration of bone can occur secondary to deposition in soil, thermal effects, and contact with metal objects; contact with oxidized copper, such as jacket of projectile, can produce light green discoloration of boneCut marks: If partially skeletonized remains need to be dismembered for final removal of soft tissue, careless use of scalpels and other sharp objects can mark skeletal remainsRodent gnawing: Rodents gnaw cortical bone to obtain minerals, including calcium; characteristic appearance are numerous parallel small grooves in bone at surfaceCarnivore scavenging: Carnivores will often chew on proximal and distal ends of long bones to retrieve bone marrow; gnawing can produce round puncture sites in surface of boneAncillary TestingObtaining Material for DNACortical bone and teeth can serve as source for DNACommon bones used are femur (shaft), tibia (shaft), or bones of footWhen taking fragment of shaft for DNA, it is best to not cut entirely through diameter of shaft and instead just cut down to marrow cavity and block out 2 cm or larger segment; this preserves integrity of shaft of bone (i.e., does not divide bone into 2 fragments)ReportingGeneral ConsiderationsReport of skeletal remains should include list of bones present, including their sidedness, estimation of sex, age at time of death, ancestry, and stature as well as identification of trauma (antemortem, perimortem, or postmortem), morphologic variants, natural disease, and postmortem changesAbility to include biological profile will depend upon skeletal remains present; e.g., with complete skeleton, estimation of sex, age at death, ancestry, and stature should be possible; however, if sternum is only bone present, ability to develop complete biological profile will be impaired"

seen in small children, debilitated adultsDrowned by running tap water, small puddles, ponds, buckets, toiletsSuspect homicide if victim is concealed, over 15 months of age, or injured/abused in other waysBathtub drowningRare except in small children, infantsIn adults, usually natural deaths while bathing or associated with debilitation (disease, drugs, trauma) leading to unconsciousness\"Bath resuscitation\": Behavior in some drug communities on belief drug OD can be reversed by immersion in bathtubVictim usually clothed, partially submerged, recent drug useDeaths often in clusters within

cartridge is terminology used with rifles and handguns, not shotgunsPrimer (cap): Chemical mixture that explodes with heat or contact of firing pin, igniting propellantLead azide, lead styphnate, barium nitrate commonHistoric: Mercury fulminate, antimony sulfide, potassium chlorate, powdered glassPropellant (powder): Ignited by primer; explodes to create large gas volume to eject shotModern: Smokeless powder: Cellulose nitrate, nitroglycerin; increased gas, higher velocity of projectile, much less residueHistoric: Black powder: Potassium nitrate, sulfur, charcoal; abundant solid residual material; slower velocity of projectileBullet: Commonly lead in low-velocity weapons; may have jacket; different shapes and nose constructionJacket: Metal covering (full jacket) or partially covering (semijacket) bulletsUsed in automatic, semiautomatic pistols, high-velocity firearms, militaryGliding metal prevents melting of lead bulletMay separate from bullet when target is hitCopper, nickel, and aluminium are common jacket materials\"Gliding bullet\": Lead bullet with copper or alloy layerNose: Ballistic characteristics depend on \"nose\" (forward-most portion) of projectileRound: Comes to point, most commonHollow point : Depression in nose, mushrooms on contact, slows bullet, greater injury path and reduced potential for body exitWadcutter: Flat nose, cannelures on body, intermediate injury potentialSpecialty bullets: Different firing characteristics for different rolesIncludes plastic, exploding, frangible, blanks, sabot, and flechette bulletsUncommon in forensic practiceCase: Encloses all parts of cartridgeUsually with identifiers of caliber, load, and manufacturerFunctions to expand and seal chamber against rearward gas escape when firedFiring pin location may be rim, pin-fire, or center-fireShell: Holds pellets and firing components for shotgun; comparable to cartridge for rifles and handgunsPrimer: Chemical mixture that ignites on firing; located at base of shellPropellant: Powder (usually smokeless) providing explosive gas expansion to propel shell from firearmWadding: Material used to separate propellant and shotCardboard, plastic commonSeveral variations with different ammunitionFiller: Small granules, usually white polyethylene, used to fill spaces between larger shotCup: Component of more modern shells, holds pellets and may replace some wadding layersPellets, \"shot\": Usually round and multiple; size designated commercially by letters and numbers; larger numbers are smaller sizedBirdshot: Smaller pellet diameter for small prey; 50-500 pellets per shellBuckshot: Larger diameter pellets for larger prey;

atherosclerotic occlusions are frequently identified within proximal aspect of LAD or LCA, or anywhere along RCAFixed occlusions causing < 70% luminal area narrowing are often considered as asymptomaticFixed occlusions causing > 70% luminal area narrowing are often symptomatic with increased cardiac demandFixed occlusions causing > 90% luminal area narrowing may be symptomatic at restGenerally accepted that for single-vessel involvement, lesions with 75% luminal area narrowing can cause sudden cardiac deathMyocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death are frequently result of acute plaque change (i.e., intraluminal thrombus formation upon site of plaque rupture)In cases of acute thrombosis causing sudden cardiac death, majority of underlying atherosclerotic lesions were asymptomatic prior to plaque rupture and thrombus formationAdrenergic stimulation can predispose vulnerable plaques to rupture (intense emotional stress is associated with development of acute MI)Hypertensive Cardiovascular DiseaseMost hypertensive patients have idiopathic (essential) hypertensionSmall percentage of patients have hypertension due to underlying disorders commonly involving kidneys or adrenal glands (e.g., renal artery stenosis or Cushing syndrome) (secondary hypertension)Hypertension is major cause of left ventricular hypertrophyLeft ventricular hypertrophy is commonly

InfarctionMost frequently due to atherosclerotic CAD (i.e., acute thrombosis of ruptured atherosclerotic plaque)Small percentage of cases due to coronary artery vasospasm or embolic event (e.g., from valve vegetation)Infarcts limited to subendocardial myocardium (i.e., nontransmural) can result from severe coronary artery atherosclerosis (without thrombosis) due to marginal perfusion in setting of

aneurysms Thoracic aneurysms also associated with connective tissue disorders (e.g., Marfan syndrome), bicuspid aortic valves, and tertiary syphilis Aortic DissectionDefined by presence of blood within arterial media (introduced through intimal tear)Instigating intimal tear typically located within ascending aortaDissection through media can occur retrograde (toward heart) or distally (toward abdominal aorta)Historically associated with aortic aneurysm (referred to as dissecting aneurysm); however, aortic dissection can occur in absence of aortic aneurysmMajority of patients are

femoral bloodCollect in tube containing sodium or potassium fluoride preservativesGray top tubesFluoride ions act as enzymatic inhibitors to prevent further ethanol production after collectionAs feasible, additional samples (e.g., urine and vitreous) should also be collected and retainedAvoid collecting blood via blind needle sticks into chestVitreous can serve as viable sample sourceAt equilibrium, vitreous:blood ratio is 1.2Equilibrium of vitreous alcohol trails blood alcohol by 1-2 hoursIf vitreous alcohol concentration is < BAC, decedent died during absorptive phaseSkeletal muscle can also be analyzedTesting on embalmed bodies can be accomplished with vitreous or muscle samplesReportingToxicology InterpretationWhile qualitative measurements of ethanol in postmortem samples is simple to obtain, interpretation of those results requires consideration ofCondition of bodyInterval between death and autopsyEnvironmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity)Nature of analyzed specimenEthanol can be produced within body after deathBacterial fermentation of glucose during decompositionTypical levels produced during decomposition are < 0.07g/dL; in rare cases, has been reported to reach 0.1-0.2 g/dLPostmortem diffusion of alcohol from stomach to central blood has been reported in association with bouts of heavy drinkingPlasma/serum to whole blood ratios are reported as 1.10-1.35 (average 1.18)Concentrations measured in whole blood are < that in plasma/serum, as whole blood contains less water than does plasma/serum, and alcohol distributes uniformly according to body waterDuring absorptive phase, arterial blood may have 40% higher alcohol concentration than venous blood (this difference is not present during postabsorptive phase)Urine alcohol concentrations not useful for estimating BACAlcohol concentrations must be interpreted in context of additional drugs/medications with synergistic effects (e.g., benzodiazepines, opiates, etc.)Death

drinkHallucinationsDisorientation Confusion and agitationTachycardia and hypertension Constitutes a medical emergencyReported mortality rates up to 5%Investigative ConsiderationsGeneral ConsiderationsPresence of alcohol/alcohol containers is important consideration at any sceneMust also be cognizant of alternative alcohol sources (e.g., empty bottles of mouthwash or cold/cough syrup) Alcohol is frequent contributing factor in motor vehicle crash incidentsAlcohol use history should be obtained from family/friends as appropriate With chronic abusers, absence of alcohol at scene may be only indication of withdrawal With acute intoxication, decedents may roll/fall into compromising positions while unconsciousPositional asphyxia Position of decedents should be documented with thorough photography Presence of dark brown granular blood (\"coffee-ground emesis\") may indicate acute gastrointestinal hemorrhagic eventAcute gastrointestinal hemorrhage can produce large quantities of expelled bloodQuantity of blood on decedent and at scene may mimic traumatic event Autopsy FindingsAcute Intoxication Potential findings are nonspecificPulmonary congestion and edemaGastric mucosal injuryHepatic steatosisDistended bladderAspiration of vomitus Individuals dying from acute intoxication may show disease processes associated with chronic abuse (e.g., cirrhosis, dilated cardiomyopathy, etc.)Acute Withdrawal\nDiagnosis is largely dependent on scene findings, investigation, and toxicology resultsNonspecific autopsy findings might include Dehydration pattern of electrolytes on vitreous chemistryIntramuscular hemorrhage of tongue (from seizure activity)Chronic UseChronic alcohol use is associated with wide variety of disease processes, includingHepatic cirrhosis May be associated with jaundice or scleral icterusEsophageal varices May be associated with acute gastrointestinal hemorrhagePancreatitis (acute or chronic)Dilated cardiomyopathy Cerebellar vermal atrophyAcute Wernicke encephalopathy manifest as mammillary body hemorrhageAncillary TestingToxicologyAntemortem specimens are preferable over postmortem when availableOptimal sample site is femoral bloodCollect in tube containing sodium or potassium fluoride preservativesGray top tubesFluoride ions act as enzymatic inhibitors to prevent further ethanol production after collectionAs feasible, additional samples (e.g., urine and vitreous) should also be collected and retainedAvoid collecting blood via blind needle sticks into chestVitreous can serve as viable sample sourceAt equilibrium, vitreous:blood ratio is 1.2Equilibrium of vitreous alcohol trails blood alcohol by 1-2 hoursIf vitreous alcohol concentration is < BAC, decedent died during absorptive phaseSkeletal muscle can also be analyzedTesting on embalmed bodies can be accomplished with vitreous or muscle samplesReportingToxicology InterpretationWhile qualitative measurements of ethanol in postmortem samples is simple to obtain, interpretation of those results requires consideration ofCondition of bodyInterval between death and autopsyEnvironmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity)Nature of analyzed specimenEthanol can be produced within body after deathBacterial fermentation of glucose during decompositionTypical levels produced during decomposition are < 0.07g/dL; in rare cases, has been reported to reach 0.1-0.2 g/dLPostmortem diffusion of alcohol from stomach to central blood has been reported in association with bouts of heavy drinkingPlasma/serum to whole blood ratios are reported as 1.10-1.35 (average 1.18)Concentrations measured in whole blood are < that in plasma/serum, as whole blood contains less water than does plasma/serum, and alcohol distributes uniformly according to body waterDuring absorptive phase, arterial blood may have 40% higher alcohol concentration than venous blood (this difference is not present during postabsorptive phase)Urine alcohol concentrations not useful for estimating BACAlcohol concentrations must be interpreted in context of additional drugs/medications with synergistic effects (e.g., benzodiazepines, opiates, etc.)Death from acute alcohol intoxication is routinely classified as accidentDeath from chronic alcohol abuse is routinely classified as natural"

naturally occurring chemical found in opium (e.g., morphine, codeine, thebaine)Opioid is synthetic or manufactured drug resembling or mimicking effects of opiatesSemisynthetic opioids are those opioids derived from naturally occurring opiates (e.g., heroin, oxycodone, and hydrocodone)Synthetic opioids are those opioids derived in laboratory, not from opium poppy (e.g., methadone and fentanyl)Narcotic is derived from Greek narkotikon, meaning \"to be numb\"Morphine is derived from Morpheus, Greek god of dreamsOVERVIEWSource of Heroin and MorphineOpiates are derived from Papaver somniforum plant, commonly known as opium poppyRaw opium was only known analgesic in early recorded historyNaturally occurring opiates derived from poppy resin (opium) includeMorphineMost prevalent opium alkaloid (opium contains 10-16% morphine)Poppy seeds may contain morphine at concentrations of 4-200 mg/kgCan be used as drug, or for production of semisynthetic opioidsHeroin (diacetylmorphine) is synthesized from morphineCodeine, while naturally occurring in opium, is also commonly synthesized from morphineCodeineMinor component of opium (opium contains 0.5% codeine)Used as analgesic, cough suppressantThebaineUsed for synthesis of semisynthetic opioids (e.g., oxycodone and hydrocodone)Regions of prominent opium production include Mexico, Southeast Asia, Southwest Asia, and South AmericaRoutes of AdministrationMorphine is availableIn liquid preparations (for either oral ingestion or injection)As tablet or capsuleAs suppositoryHeroin is availableAs powder (white or black)As black tar-like substanceHeroin may be injected, smoked, or snortedCLINICAL ISSUESMetabolism of MorphineMorphine has t1/2 of 2-3 hoursMajority of administered morphine is converted in liver to inactive metabolite, morphine-3-glucoronideMorphine-6-glucuronide is active metaboliteMetabolism of Heroint1/2Heroin: 2-6 minutes6-MAM: 6-40 minutesMorphine: 2-3 hoursHeroin is rapidly deacetylated in blood (by blood esterases) to 6-MAM6-MAM is further hydrolyzed to morphine (presumably in liver)Physiologic EffectsOpiates and opioids act upon opioid receptors in brainNotably Î¼ receptorEndogenous activators of opioid receptors include endorphinsMorphine and heroin act asCNS depressantsAnalgesicsIn brain tissue, heroin has very little affinity for opioid receptorsNarcotic activity of heroin is attributed to 6-MAM and morphineModerate doses of morphine or heroin produceEuphoriaConstricted (pinpoint) pupilsNauseaConstipationHigher doses may produceDrowsiness, sedation, or comaRespiratory depressionDepressed cough reflexToxicityFatal outcomes are not directly related to morphine blood levelsMorphine concentrations in overdose victims vary widely, depending on decedent's prior narcotic

        "raw_text": "Historical OriginsAncient EgyptEgypt was among first civilizations to apply forensic practicesMedicine and law were united in work of priests that served as both physicians and juristsImhotep (ca. 2667-2648 BC), founder of ancient Egyptian medicine, has been described as first medicolegal expertPliny (Roman author) recorded that bodies of those who died were examined to ascertain cause of deathDeterminations regarding cause and manner of death were likely made by priestsFairly extensive knowledge of toxicology was requiredMedical practice and treatment was heavily influenced by religion, superstition, and magicAncient Egyptian texts demonstrate detailed knowledge of anatomy, but scholars debate whether this came from animal or human studyRemoval of internal organs was performed but as component of embalming processEmbalmers were of low social classRemoval of organs provided embalmers opportunity to observe natural and diseased organ statesHowever, embalmers likely did not communicate with priests or other upper class individuals practicing medicineKing Ptolemy I Soter (ca. 367-282 BC) established university and library in AlexandriaPtolemy authorized medical officials to dissect and examine bodiesMost early dissections were performed on criminalsMembers of royal family occasionally attendedAncient GreeceAnatomy played only small part in early Greek medical theoryAncient Greek system of medicine was based on balance of 4 humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile)Function of internal organs was thought to be limited to production and circulation of these humorsScholars have debated whether early Greeks performed human dissections; it is likely no human dissections were performed in Greek world prior to 3rd century BCBy 3rd century BC, human dissection was allowed with official approval in Alexandria for study of normal anatomy and diseasePhysicians Herophilus (ca. 335-280 BC) and Erasistratus (ca. 310-250 BC) performed systematic dissections on prisoners provided from royal jailHerophilusPerformed 1st known autopsies for characterizing course of diseaseWrote treatise on human anatomyRegarded as the \"father of anatomy\"ErasistratusLargely abandoned prevalent humoral theory in favor of solidist theory, realizing that diseases were associated with changes in solid organsContributions of Herophilus and Erasistratus to anatomy and disease were significant but short livedBoth Herophilus and Erasistratus have been accused of vivisection, dissecting prisoners \"while they were yet breathing\"Galen (ca. AD 130-210)Best known for his systemization and innovation of Hippocratic medical traditionStudied anatomy principally through dissection and vivisection of animals (pigs and apes)Credited as 1st to correlate patient complaints and symptoms with what was found upon examination of affected area of deceasedHis written masterpiece, On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body, was based on humoral theory (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) and dominated medical thought for centuriesRomansAutopsy of Julius Caesar (March 44 BC) is recognized as earliest recorded autopsy report in historyPhysician Antistius offered opinion that of 23 stab wounds, none were fatal except for wound to breastAntistius' report gave rise to Latin term forensics, meaning \"before the forum\" (where Antistius delivered his opinion)Justinian enactments (529-564)Provided for regulation of practice of medicineRequired proof of competence by means of examinationImposed penalties for malpracticeCharacterized function of medical expert as assisting judiciary by impartial interpretation and opinion based on specialized knowledgeRegarded as highest point of achievement in forensic medicine in ancient worldMiddle Ages and RenaissanceEast AsiaIn 6th century, Chinese physician Chich-ts'si wrote 1st known treatise on forensic medicineDuring Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392), published texts on forensic medicine were in useIn 1247, Song Ci edited classic Chinese text on death investigation (Xi-Yuan-Lu, or Records for Washing Away of Wrong Cases)Emphasized role of officers investigating deaths, rather than that of medical practitionersRecognized as world's 1st systemic handbook for postmortem examinationsEventually translated into numerous languagesCovered findings in cases of infanticide, drowning, hanging, poisoning, and assaultEuropeReports from 4th and 10th centuries indicate that autopsies were being performed on corpses of criminalsIn late Middle Ages, 1st recorded autopsies were performed chiefly to identify causes of suspicious deathsBy Renaissance, predominant purpose of autopsy was for anatomic dissectionRenaissance is referred to as \"golden age of anatomy\"Andreas Vesalius published De Humani Corporis Fabrica in 1543, the founding text of modern anatomyIn EnglandCoroners were formalized in 1194 by Richard the Lionhearted's Articles of EyreProvided for custos placitorum coronae (keepers of pleas of crown, or coroners)Coroner duties included holding inquests, valuing objects for taxation, obtaining arrest warrants, and ensuring that potential murders were investigatedIn ItalyPope Innocent III provided for appointment of doctors to courts for determination of wounds in 1209In 1231, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II issued decree mandating that 1 human body should be dissected at least once every 5 years for anatomic studies at SalernoIn 1249, Hugo de Lucca took oath as medicolegal expertHuman dissections between 1266 and 1275 were of probable medicolegal natureUniversity of Bologna was largely controlled by law facultyAutopsies were likely solicited to solve legal problems, rather than to promote medical knowledgeClearly recorded case of autopsy for purpose of investigating cause of death dates to 1286In 1302, judge in Bologna ordered autopsy of nobleman who had died under suspicious circumstancesAntipope Alexander V was autopsied in 1410 to investigate possibility of poisoningPhysician Fortunato FedeleMade career of performing autopsies and testifying in courtPublished book on forensic medicine (De Relationes Medicorum) in 1602Paolo ZacchiasPublished 3 volumes on forensic medicine (Quaestiones Medico-Legales) between 1621 and 1651Has been called \"father of forensic medicine\"In GermanyCode of Bamburg (1507) authorized opening of bodies to examine depth and damage caused by woundsCaroline Code (1553) required expert medical testimony to guide judges in cases of murder, wounding, poisoning, hanging, drowning, infanticide, abortion, and other circumstances involving injury to personJohannes Bohn (1640-1718) was pioneer in development of medicolegal autopsiesIn FranceAmbroise Pare (1510-1590)Considered the 1st forensic pathologistWrote on traumatic injuries of organsModern HistoryEast AsiaDuring Japan's Edo period (1603-1868)Coroner investigations were mandatory for cases involving death and unusual incidentsOfficials who investigated scenes were known as kenshi (\"coroners\")EuropeIn EnglandIn 1788, Samuel Farr wrote Elements of Medical Jurisprudence, which contained descriptions of findings required for judgment by coroners and courts of law in cases, including rape and murderIn 1789, Andrew Duncan began lecturing on legal medicine and public healthChair of Forensic Medicine was established at University of Edinburgh in 1803In ItalyIn 1761, anatomist Giovanni Morgagni published De Sedibus based on observations from hundreds of autopsy dissectionsCredited with establishing concept of clinical-pathologic correlationIn Germany and Austria1st known medicolegal clinic established in Vienna ~ 1830 (and 2nd one in Berlin in 1833)Carl von Rokitansky performed 30,000 autopsies at Second Vienna Medical SchoolBasics of modern autopsy techniques were developed by Friedrich Zenker (1825-1898) and Rudolph Virchow (1821-1902)In France1st professional Chair in Legal Medicine established in 1794In 1803, provision required judges to appoint medical experts who were graduates in medicine and had passed examination in legal medicine1st medicolegal clinic established in 1840AmericaColonists brought English coroner system to America1st recorded coroner's inquest in America occurred in 1635 (Plymouth Colony)As early as 1636, role of coroner transitioned from appointed to elected positionBy late 17th century, coroner's autopsies were on record (including a 1691 autopsy of a New York governor presumed to have been poisoned)Dr. J. S. Stringham began lecturing on legal medicine in New York around 1804In 1813, first Chair of Medical Jurisprudence established in New York CityIn 1860, Maryland law enabled coroner to require presence of physician at inquestsIn 1868, physician was appointed coroner of BaltimoreIn 1877, \"medical examiners\" replaced coroners in Massachusetts; first official use of termIn 1890, physicians performing autopsies for coroners in Baltimore are referred to as \"medical examiners\"New York City established 1st true medical examiner system in 1918, replacing their coroner's officeIn 1939, Maryland establishes 1st state medical examiner officeIn 1959, American Board of Pathology began to offer board certification in forensic pathologyNational Association of Medical Examiners (NAME) established in 1966",

        "raw_text": "TERMINOLOGYSynonymsBell mania, acute exhaustive mania, agitated mania, and fatal catatoniaDefinitionsDelirium is syndrome of cognitive disturbances characterized by alterations in consciousness, orientation, memory, thought, and behaviorExcited delirium is delirium characterized by agitation, aggressive or violent behaviorExcited delirium syndrome is sudden death of person following period of excited delirium for which autopsy does not disclose evidence of sufficient trauma or natural disease to otherwise explain deathOVERVIEWGeneral ConsiderationsDelirium is state of acute disturbance in cognition and consciousnessGeneral features includeDisorientation to space and timeDisorganized thought processesDisorganized speechHallucinationsExcited delirium is delirium involving violent behaviorExcited delirium was first described as Bell mania by Dr. Luther Bell in 1849Potentially fatal form of delirium in mentally ill patientsPatients presented withÂ fever, agitation, and inability to sleepViolent behaviors often necessitated physical restraintSymptoms persisted over chronic course (days to months), with death usually occurring after several weeks Reports of fatal cases of Bell mania dissipated in 1950s with introduction of phenothiazinesAcute form of excited delirium was described in 1980s in association with illicit stimulants (e.g., cocaine and methamphetamine)Follows characteristic sequence of eventsDelirium with agitation (e.g., fear, panic, and violent, bizarre, or hyperactive behaviors)Struggle with physical restraintSudden cessation of struggleCardiorespiratory arrest and deathDiffers from Bell mania in thatCases strongly associated with stimulant drug use Death occurs within minutes to hours of symptom onsetCLINICAL ISSUESCase Presentation In its present form, excited delirium syndrome is strongly associated with abuse of illegal stimulantsMost commonly cocaine or methamphetamineRarely phencyclidine (PCP)Most patients are male, and majority do not have underlying mental illnessCases involving patients with underlying mental illness do occur but are less frequent On initial assessment, it is difficult (if not impossible) to distinguish cases of excited delirium due to stimulant abuse from excited delirium due to mental illnessMajority of cases are associated with displays of unexpected strength &/or hyperthermiaDeath invariably occurs within minutes to hours after struggle with police or medical personnel involving use of physical restraints Excited delirium syndrome is acute condition, in contrast to chronic nature of Bell maniaDeath is characterized by cardiopulmonary arrest resistant to cardiopulmonary resuscitative efforts Mechanism of Disease and DeathExcited delirium syndrome is associated with activation of sympathetic nervous system, notably with elevated levels of dopaminePsychostimulants (e.g., cocaine and methamphetamine) increase synaptic levels of dopamine Chronic cocaine use normally leads to compensatory upregulation in dopamine transporters (which aids to clear excessive dopamine from synapses) It is theorized with excited delirium syndrome, there is failure of upregulation of dopamine transporters, and resultant excessive dopamine signaling (i.e., functional hyperdopaminergia) triggers delirium and precipitates autonomic dysfunctionHyperadrenergic state may then cause cardiac dysrhythmia, accounting for fatal outcomesHypothalamic dopamine receptors control thermoregulation, and thus dopamine dysregulation may further account for profound hyperthermia characteristic of excited delirium Means and nature of physical restraint may alternatively suggest death due to positional or traumatic asphyxia Assertion of positional or traumatic asphyxia must be weighed against known case circumstances and published scientific data regarding practicality of restraint-induced hypoxia INVESTIGATIVE CONSIDERATIONSScene InvestigationsComplete and thorough scene investigation is of paramount importance, to include detailed photographic documentationDiagnosis of excited delirium syndrome is largely dependent on investigative circumstances Police reports, emergency medical service reports, and witness statements should all be collected and reviewed In unwitnessed cases, attempts at self-cooling (placement of cold towels, immersion in water) may signify hyperthermiaHyperthermia is important hallmark of excited delirium syndrome and is regarded as harbinger of death Medical Records Past medical records should be collectedMedication list should be reviewed, with attention to drugs with known cardiotoxic effects (e.g., QT prolongation)Clinical features of excited delirium syndrome includeAcute mental status changeAgitationAdrenergic dysfunctionTachycardiaTachypneaHyperthermia DiaphoresisNoncompliance (with police or medical personnel) Increased pain tolerance and unusual strengthAbundant energy and lack of fatigue If there is cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation and ensuing prolonged survival, patients may also develop RhabdomyolysisAcute renal failureDisseminated intravascular coagulation AUTOPSY FINDINGSGeneral ConsiderationsUseful approach to autopsy in cases of suspected excited delirium syndrome is to identify or exclude other intervening injuries or diseases Reported cases of excited delirium syndrome are often associated with significant natural disease (e.g., atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease) that is felt to be contributory to death by making individuals more susceptible to fatal cardiac dysrhythmiaIn other instances, autopsy findings may be minimal External Examination By definition, discovered injuries (e.g., abrasions, contusions) are minorDocument with photography to include pertinent negative findings Internal Examination Complete autopsy should be performed Perform anterior neck dissectionCut-downs of torso and extremities should be considered ANCILLARY TESTINGToxicologyToxicology testing is fundamental step in evaluation of excited delirium syndromeRequest and analyze hospital admission blood samples, if applicable and available Samples should be collected from multiples sources (e.g., peripheral blood, vitreous, urine, &/or bile)Vast majority of cases of excited delirium syndrome will be positive for illicit stimulants, either cocaine or methamphetamine Other reported drugs include PCP, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), cathinones (bath salts), and prescription psychiatric medicationsHistologyHistologic evaluation of organs is important step in properly excluding presence of natural diseaseSample and evaluate cardiac conduction system (e.g., sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes)OtherConsider retention of brain or brain slices, and neuropathology consultation, depending on individual case circumstancesConsider genetic testing for conduction system abnormalities, depending on individual case circumstances Elevations in levels of brain heat shock proteins [i.e., heat shock protein 70 (hsp70)] have been reportedBiomarker of hyperthermiaREPORTINGDeath CertificationDeterminations of cause and manner of death in cases of suspected excited delirium syndrome may have implications regarding allegations of police misconduct or brutality Due to common negative findings (i.e., lack of identifiable injuries), allegations of \"cover-ups\" are not infrequent Rulings should not be issued until ancillary testing has been completed, and all pertinent records have been collected and reviewedDue consideration must be given to alternative intervening causes (e.g., neck or chest compression, blunt force injuries, or significant natural disease) Cause of death statements may be descriptive (e.g., \"cardiac dysrhythmia complicating struggle with physical restraint in a person under the influence of methamphetamine\") Given contribution of physical struggle, manner of death is best classified as either homicide or
