however, no features that allow for determination of antemortem or postmortem are presentPostmortem: Occurring after deathOs coxae: Term used for fused ilium, ischium, and pubisOverviewRole of Forensic AnthropologistAssist with recovery of skeletal remains at scene, whether surface scatter or burialDetermination of human vs. nonhuman remainsDevelopment of biological profile from human skeletal remainsSex of individualAge at time of death of individual, including whether remains are adult or subadultAncestry of individualStature of individualIdentification of trauma, natural disease, morphologic variants, and postmortem changeInvestigationImportant ConsiderationsAnthropologists can assist in identification of clandestine gravesPosition of skeletal remains can provide vital information for investigation (e.g., position body was placed into ground); therefore, just removing remains and sending bones to anthropologist is not best practice, having anthropologist present, if possible, when remains are unearthed is bestAs with position of remains in ground providing information, so can pattern of surface scatter when bones are found above ground, and once again, having anthropologist present for recovery of remains is bestAutopsyDetermination of Human vs. Nonhuman RemainsGeneral considerationsMost common type of bone brought to law enforcement, coroners, medical examiners, or forensic pathologists is nonhuman boneMost nonhuman bones have same name as their human counterpart, with one exception being astragalus, which is nonhuman equivalent of talusMost nonhuman bones have similar structure to their human counterpart, thus serving as potential concern when found by publicAlthough nonhuman bones have similar structure to their human counterpart, some are fused or incompleteIn animals, radius and ulna are often fusedIn animals, fibula is often incomplete with small fragment of proximal fibula present and fused with tibiaBooks and other resources are available (e.g., wildlife education programs at college) for identification of genus and species if so desiredComparison with human skeleton will easily allow for separation of human from nonhumanCommon species encountered by publicDeer, in both urban and rural environmentsMany others, including pigs, bears, dogs, horses, cattle, and birds (e.g., blue herons, chickens)Common nonhuman bones encountered by public and brought to law enforcement or other investigating agencyBear paws, either forepaw or hindpawBear paws are often discarded after processing of bear hide, and these discarded paws can be found by publicDecomposed bear paw closely resembles human hand or footX-ray of bear paw will reveal numerous sesamoid bones (in additional to other differences), which can easily allow for determination that found remains are nonhumanMetapodials, which is generalized term for both metacarpals and metatarsalsAt distal end of metapodial is pulley-like structure with 2 raised ridges for articulation with proximal phalanges; no human bone has similar-appearing structureFemur and tibiaIn deer, in addition to other features, tibial tuberosity projects more than in humans and femoral neck is shorter and less prominent than humansRibs and vertebraeIn deer, vertebrae tend to have longer transverse and spinous processes than humansAtlas and axis are much larger (i.e., less delicate) than in humansRibs from deer are straighter than human ribs, as trunk of animal is directed downwardCalcaneus and astragalusCranium and mandible; however, given characteristic different appearance from human, these bones are rarely brought in by public with concerns that they are humanDevelopment of Biological Profile From Human Skeletal RemainsGeneral considerationsWhen assessing skeletal remains for sex, ancestry, age of individual at time of death, and stature, forensic anthropologist is making estimation as to those featuresWhen using biological profile developed by forensic anthropologist, that individual is different sex or ancestry or of different stature or age at time of death must be always be considered by those using that biological profile in their investigation (e.g., law enforcement)Determination of sex of individualGeneral considerations3 main bones used to determine sex of individual: Os coxae, cranium, and long bones, specifically diameter of femoral &/or humeral headNumerous articles exist for using wide range of other bones to determine sexFeatures of os coxaeConsidered bone that can most accurately estimate sex of individualPhenice criteria for determination of sex from pelvisVentral arc: Present in females, absent in malesIschiopubic ramus: Ridge on medial aspect in females, broad in malesSubpubic concavity: Present in females, absent in malesOther features to help distinguish male from femaleShape of greater sciatic notch: Narrow in females, broad in malesOverall shape of pelvis: Broader in females, narrower in malesPreauricular sulcus: More commonly present in females than malesFeatures of craniumAlthough not as definitive as pelvic traits, cranial traits often allow for accurate estimation of sex5 features to predict sex from craniumNuchal crest (and external occipital protuberance): Well-developed in males, less well-developed in femalesMastoid process: Larger in males, smaller in femalesSupraorbital margin: Thick and rounded in males, thinner and sharp in femalesGlabella: More prominent and projecting forward in males, flatter and less projection forward in femalesMental eminence: Prominent in males, less prominent in femalesComparison of cranium and mandible being examined to reference diagram will assist in assigning score to each of above 5 traits, which will allow for estimation of male vs. femaleFeatures of long bonesFemoral and humeral head diameter can be used to estimate male vs. female sexDetermination of age of individual at time of deathGeneral considerationsDetermination for subadults is based upon physiologic process (i.e., timing of closure of growth plates) and is fairly consistentDetermination for adults is based upon degenerative processes (i.e., wear and tear on bone) and is inconsistentEpiphyseal closure to determine age at time of deathBones are examined for epiphyses and whether they are not fused to diaphysis (i.e., open), partially fused (i.e., partial union), or completely fused (i.e., complete union)Timing of growth plate closure varies throughout body, and because of this variance, numerous locations can be assessed and general age at time of death determinedCompared to determination of age at time of death of adult, examination of skeletal system and assessment of closure of growth plates in subadult provides for relatively accurate assessmentDentition: In subadult, x-rays of maxilla and mandible allows for assessment of eruption of teeth; comparison with standard charts allows for prediction of age at time of death based upon eruption pattern presentFeatures of pubic symphysis to determine age at time of deathOf all methods, assessment of morphologic features of pubic symphysis to estimate age of individual at time of death is considered most reliableSuchey-Brooks and Todd scoring systems are most commonly usedVisual assessment of face of pubic symphysis for billows, development of ventral rampart, dorsal plateau, and superior and inferior extremities is performed to assign pubic symphysis to 1 of 5 stages (Suchey-Brooks) or 1 of 10 stages (Todd); stages have established range for age at time of death associated with eachCollections of casts for comparison are availableFeatures of auricular surface to determine age at time of deathAuricular surface is location at which os coxae articulates with sacrumApex, superior and inferior demiface, and retroauricular area are assessed for billowing, granularity, density, and porosity and assigned to 1 of 8 stages; each stage has age range associated with itFeatures of rib ends to determine age at time of deathEstimation of age at time of death using rib ends is preferably done with 4th ribVisual assessment of articular surface with presence or absence of billowing, depth and shape of pit, and wall of pit with presence or absence of scalloping and presence or absence of bony projections is made and rib assigned to 1 of 8 phases; each phase has age range associated with itFeatures of cranial sutures to determine age at time of deathGenerally considered one of least reliable methods for estimating age at time of deathCranial sutures are assessed as to whether they are open, minimally closed, significantly closed, or obliteratedNumerous locations on ectocranium (vault and lateral-anterior), palate, and, if accessible, endocranium are assessed; each location is assigned score, and total score allows for prediction of age at time of deathDetermination of ancestry of individualGeneral considerationsEstimation of ancestry is most often based upon features of cranium and mandibleEstimation of ancestry can be made both upon morphologic features as well as cranial measurementsFordisc 3.0 is program used by anthropologists to determine ancestry based upon cranial measurementsAncestry of living individual is often at least in part social construct, which is not necessarily representative of their biological structure; thus, assessment of biologic structure for ancestry may lead to erroneous conclusions as to how living individual's ancestry was representedNative Americans share similar morphologic traits with AsiansFeatures of cranium often used for estimation of ancestryNasal bone contour: Varies from low and rounded to steepled with no superior surface plateauLow and rounded nasal bone contour is more frequently associated with individuals of African ancestrySteepled nasal bone contour is more frequently associated with individuals of European ancestryNasal aperture width: Varying from narrow to wideNarrow nasal aperture is more frequently associated with European ancestryWide nasal aperture is more frequently associated with African ancestryAnterior nasal spine: Varies from short to longShort anterior nasal spine is more frequently associated with African ancestryLong anterior nasal spine is more frequently associated with European ancestryInferior nasal margin: Varies from guttered to sillGuttered, or gradual sloping, of inferior nasal margin is more frequently associated with African ancestrySill or prominent ridge between nasal floor and maxilla is more frequently associated with European ancestryNasal overgrowth: Either absent or presentAbsent nasal overgrowth is more frequently associated with European ancestryNasal overgrowth is more frequently associated with African ancestrySupranasal suture: Varies from absent to closed, but can be visible Zygomatic projection: Zygomatic bone is either retreating or projectingRetreating zygomatic bone is more frequently associated with European or African ancestryProjecting zygomatic bone is more frequently associated with Asian ancestryMalar tubercle: Varies from absent to present with incipient and trace as intermediary categoriesAbsent malar tubercle is more frequently associated with African ancestryTrace malar tubercle is more frequently associated with European ancestryInterorbital breadth: Varies from narrow to wideNarrow interorbital breadth is more frequently associated with European ancestryWide interorbital breadth is more frequently associated with African ancestryZygomaxillary suture: Forms include smooth, angled, and S-shapedSmooth zygomaxillary suture is more frequently associated with African ancestryAngled zygomaxillary suture is more frequently associated with Asian ancestryS-shaped (or zigzag) zygomaxillary suture is more frequently associated with European ancestryAlveolar prognathism: Either orthognathic (flat midfacial profile) or prognathic (projecting midfacial profile)Orthognathic is more frequently associated with European or Asian ancestryPrognathic is more frequently associated with European ancestryTransverse palatine suture has several formsStraight and symmetrical: Associated with Asian ancestryAnterior bulging: Associated with African ancestryAnterior and posterior deviation of suture at midline: Associated with European ancestryMandibular torus: Present or absentPresent mandibular torus is more frequently associated with Asian ancestryAbsent mandibular torus is more frequently associated with European or African ancestryPalatine torus: Present or absentPresent palatine torus is more frequently associated with Asian ancestryAbsent mandibular torus is more frequently associated with European or African ancestryPostbregmatic depression: Present or absentPresent postbregmatic depression is more frequently associated with African ancestryAbsent postbregmatic depression is more frequently associated with European or Asian ancestryIn addition to above listed features, other morphologic features that may assist in estimation of ancestry are described in various books and articlesDentition can assist in estimation of ancestry; shoveled incisors are associated with Asian or Native American ancestryDetermination of stature of individualStature determinations are made by measurement of long bone and using that measurement in formula, which is often based upon sex and ancestry of individualFordisc 3.0 will provide stature estimations based upon measurements of long bones entered into programIdentification of TraumaGeneral features in determination of antemortem, perimortem, and postmortem traumaAntemortem trauma is identified by having reaction to trauma (i.e., callus formation, or subsequent evidence of healing of bone)Postmortem trauma often has different coloration of edge of fracture compared to adjacent cortical surface (e.g., when shovel strikes bone that has been in ground, it can break bone and expose white surface of newly exposed bone at fracture line, whereas adjacent cortex, having been exposed to soil for some time, is brown)Perimortem fractures lack features that allow for identification as antemortem or postmortemDistinction between perimortem trauma and postmortem trauma can be very difficultDetermination of perimortem trauma does not indicate that trauma occurred at time of death, only that it occurred around time of deathSome features of antemortem traumaRounded edges and callus formation; pseudoarthrosesSome features of postmortem traumaSharp edgesDifferent coloration between fracture edge and adjacent cortical surface of boneSome fracture types (e.g., longitudinal fractures extending along length of bone shaft) are more frequently found postmortem than antemortem or perimortemGeneral fracture conceptsBone is viscoelastic substance, and, as such, responds differently to different forces: When force is applied rapidly, such as gunshot wound, ↑ in stress (force/area) is much greater than ↑ in strain (new length/original length) and bone response is similar to glass and shatters Bone fragments created by gunshot wound can be reapproximated and glued back together into intact bone with its normal shape; when force is applied more slowly, such as blunt force trauma in beating with baseball bat, ↑ in strain is much greater than ↑ in stress and bone response is more like rubber in that bone bends; however, this bending reaches point where it does not reverse (i.e., plastic deformation) and then where it finally breaksWhen bone is broken in this manner (i.e., with plastic deformation) it cannot easily be reapproximated, and when glued back together, shape is not normalDifferent forms of force can act upon bone: Compression, tension, shearing, and bending and rotation, which are combination of first 3In general, bone fails 1st at tension and 2nd at compression (i.e., if rib is bent by placing 2 thumbs against surface and pushing, compression occurs at point of contact with thumbs and tension on opposite side)General classification of fracturesWhile there are numerous names for fractures (over 100 terms used), potentially all fractures of long bones can be described using some basic terms: Extent, integrity of overlying skin, direction of fracture, location of fracture, and alignment of fracture endsExtent: Complete or incompleteIntegrity of overlying skin: Open vs. closed, depending upon intactness of overlying skin, with closed fracture having intact skin and open fracture having lacerated skin (\"simple\" is older term for closed, and \"compound\" is older term for open; these older terms are not preferred)Direction of fracture: Transverse, oblique, spiralLocation of fracture: Epiphyseal, metaphyseal, diaphysealAlignment of fracture ends: Displaced or nondisplacedSpecific types of fracturesIn general, fractures of long bones can be divided into incomplete and completeIncomplete fractures are those which do not involve full-thickness of boneGreenstick fracture: Often involve shaft of bone and are associated with children due to failure of bone at point of tension with maintenance of integrity at point of compressionTorus fracture: Rounded expanse of bone produced by longitudinal compressionDepressed fracture: Involve cranium with failure of outer table of bone but with maintenance of integrity of inner table of boneComplete fractures are those which do involve full-thickness of boneTransverse fracture: Fracture line extends 90° perpendicular to cortical surfaceOblique fracture: Fracture line extends tangential to cortical surfaceSpiral fracture: Fracture line corkscrews along axis of bone; although spiral fractures have been associated with abuse in children, caution must be used, as accidents can also produce spiral fracturesComminuted fracture: Fracture characterized by multiple fragments of boneSegmental fracture: 2 fracture lines occur on same bone at separate locations, resulting in segment of bone being removed from shaftSome fracture terminology for cranium is different than that for long bonesLinear fracture: Single fracture lineDiastatic fracture: Separation of cranial bones along sutures; these most commonly occur in children but can also occur in adultsDepressed skull fracture and comminuted skull fracture are same as aboveSpecific fractures associated with specific scenariosNumber of eponyms and clinical scenarios used to name fractures is significant; only some mentioned hereColles fracture: Fracture of distal radius due to fall on out-stretched upper extremityRing fracture: Fracture encircling foramen magnum due to fall from height and landing on feet or impact to top of headParry fracture: Fracture of radius or ulna, associated with self-defense against attacker and raising forearm to ward off blowBoxer's fracture: Fracture of 4th or 5th metacarpal, associated with striking another person with fistMetaphyseal fracture (also called chip or bucket handle fracture): Associated with child abuseIdentification of Natural DiseaseCommon natural diseases encountered by forensic anthropologists include osteoporosis, Paget disease, osteoarthritis, and osteomyelitisOsteoporosisMorphology: Cut section of bone would reveal loss of bony trabeculae, resulting in decreased density of boneAssociations: Senility, postmenopausal, endocrine disorders (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, Cushing disease)Complications: Fractures, compression fractures of vertebrae, which can in turn lead to kyphoscoliosis or lumbar lordosisPaget diseaseMorphology: Thickened bone, which upon microscopic examination has mosaic patternComplications: Risk for fracture and can also create impingement at nerve and vessel foramina in craniumOsteoarthritisMorphology: Eburnation of articular surfaces can occur, which appear as smooth, shiny surface of bone, but much more commonly found are osteophytic spurs and new bone growth, often at edges of articular surfaceComplications: If osteophytic spurs connect, fusion can occur, which can result in immobilization at jointIdentification of Morphologic VariantsGeneral considerationsDescription: Morphologic variants are variants in normal anatomy, which can be identified upon examination of skeletal remainsMorphologic variants have been associated with certain ancestral groupsMorphologic variants should not be confused with trauma or natural diseaseCommon morphologic variantsMetopic suture: Suture line extending between bregma, which is intersection of coronal and sagittal sutures and nasion; this suture is between left and right frontal bone and normally closes by 8 years of age; however, it can persist in some individualsSutural bones: Accessory ossicles that appear as island in suture; they can be found at numerous locations but commonly are lambda (intersection of lambdoid sutures and sagittal suture) or bregma or along course of sagittal sutureInca bone: Large bone at apex of occipital bone at lambda, which is due to failure of fusion of ossification centers in occipital bone and is associated with mendosal sutures on endocranial surface, which can be confused with inflicted injury in childMandibular torus: Bony ridge on lingual surface of mandibleSeptal aperture: Perforation of olecranon fossa to coronoid fossa of humerus, which can resemble gunshot woundIdentification of Postmortem ChangeGeneral considerationsPostmortem change can resemble trauma or natural diseasePostmortem change can fall into one of several categories: Weathering, discoloration, cut marks, rodent gnawing or carnivore scavenging, and cultural modificationWeathering produces cracking and splitting of outer surface of boneDiscoloration of bone can occur secondary to deposition in soil, thermal effects, and contact with metal objects; contact with oxidized copper, such as jacket of projectile, can produce light green discoloration of boneCut marks: If partially skeletonized remains need to be dismembered for final removal of soft tissue, careless use of scalpels and other sharp objects can mark skeletal remainsRodent gnawing: Rodents gnaw cortical bone to obtain minerals, including calcium; characteristic appearance are numerous parallel small grooves in bone at surfaceCarnivore scavenging: Carnivores will often chew on proximal and distal ends of long bones to retrieve bone marrow; gnawing can produce round puncture sites in surface of boneAncillary TestingObtaining Material for DNACortical bone and teeth can serve as source for DNACommon bones used are femur (shaft), tibia (shaft), or bones of footWhen taking fragment of shaft for DNA, it is best to not cut entirely through diameter of shaft and instead just cut down to marrow cavity and block out 2 cm or larger segment; this preserves integrity of shaft of bone (i.e., does not divide bone into 2 fragments)ReportingGeneral ConsiderationsReport of skeletal remains should include list of bones present, including their sidedness, estimation of sex, age at time of death, ancestry, and stature as well as identification of trauma (antemortem, perimortem, or postmortem), morphologic variants, natural disease, and postmortem changesAbility to include biological profile will depend upon skeletal remains present; e.g., with complete skeleton, estimation of sex, age at death, ancestry, and stature should be possible; however, if sternum is only bone present, ability to develop complete biological profile will be impaired",

when force is applied more slowly, such as blunt force trauma in beating with baseball bat, ↑ in strain is much greater than ↑ in stress and bone response is more like rubber in that bone bends; however, this bending reaches point where it does not reverse (i.e., plastic deformation) and then where it finally breaksWhen bone is broken in this manner (i.e., with plastic deformation) it cannot easily be reapproximated, and when glued back together, shape is not normalDifferent forms of force can act upon bone: Compression, tension, shearing, and bending and rotation, which are combination of first 3In general, bone fails 1st at tension and 2nd at compression (i.e., if rib is bent by placing 2 thumbs against surface and pushing, compression occurs at point of contact with thumbs and tension on opposite side)General classification of fracturesWhile there are numerous names for fractures (over 100 terms used), potentially all fractures of long bones can be described using some basic terms: Extent, integrity of overlying skin, direction of fracture, location of fracture, and alignment of fracture endsExtent: Complete or incompleteIntegrity of overlying skin: Open vs. closed, depending upon intactness of overlying skin, with closed fracture having intact skin and open fracture having lacerated skin (\"simple\" is older term for closed, and \"compound\" is older term for open; these older terms are not preferred)Direction of fracture: Transverse, oblique, spiralLocation of fracture: Epiphyseal, metaphyseal, diaphysealAlignment of fracture ends: Displaced or nondisplacedSpecific types of fracturesIn general, fractures of long bones can be divided into incomplete and completeIncomplete fractures are those which do not involve full-thickness of boneGreenstick fracture: Often involve shaft of bone and are associated with children due to failure of bone at point of tension with maintenance of integrity at point of compressionTorus fracture: Rounded expanse of bone produced by longitudinal compressionDepressed fracture: Involve cranium with failure of outer table of bone but with maintenance of integrity of inner table of boneComplete fractures are those which do involve full-thickness of boneTransverse fracture: Fracture line extends 90° perpendicular to cortical surfaceOblique fracture: Fracture line extends tangential to cortical surfaceSpiral fracture: Fracture line corkscrews along axis of bone; although spiral fractures have been associated with abuse in children, caution must be used, as accidents can also produce spiral fracturesComminuted fracture: Fracture characterized by multiple fragments of boneSegmental fracture: 2 fracture lines occur on same bone at separate locations, resulting in segment of bone being removed from shaftSome fracture terminology for cranium is different than that for long bonesLinear fracture: Single fracture lineDiastatic fracture: Separation of cranial bones along sutures; these most commonly occur in children but can also occur in adultsDepressed skull fracture and comminuted skull fracture are same as aboveSpecific fractures associated with specific scenariosNumber of eponyms and clinical scenarios used to name fractures is significant; only some mentioned hereColles fracture: Fracture of distal radius due to fall on out-stretched upper extremityRing fracture: Fracture encircling foramen magnum due to fall from height and landing on feet or impact to top of headParry fracture: Fracture of radius or ulna, associated with self-defense against attacker and raising forearm to ward off blowBoxer's fracture: Fracture of 4th or 5th metacarpal, associated with striking another person with fistMetaphyseal fracture (also called chip or bucket handle fracture): Associated with child abuseIdentification of Natural DiseaseCommon natural diseases encountered by forensic anthropologists include osteoporosis, Paget disease, osteoarthritis, and osteomyelitisOsteoporosisMorphology: Cut section of bone would reveal loss of bony trabeculae, resulting in decreased density of boneAssociations: Senility, postmenopausal, endocrine disorders (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, Cushing disease)Complications: Fractures, compression fractures of vertebrae, which can in turn lead to kyphoscoliosis or lumbar lordosisPaget diseaseMorphology: Thickened bone, which upon microscopic examination has mosaic patternComplications: Risk for fracture and can also create impingement at nerve and vessel foramina in craniumOsteoarthritisMorphology: Eburnation of articular surfaces can occur, which appear as smooth, shiny surface of bone, but much more commonly found are osteophytic spurs and new bone growth, often at edges of articular surfaceComplications: If osteophytic spurs connect, fusion can occur, which can result in immobilization at jointIdentification of Morphologic VariantsGeneral considerationsDescription: Morphologic variants are variants in normal anatomy, which can be identified upon examination of skeletal remainsMorphologic variants have been associated with certain ancestral groupsMorphologic variants should not be confused with trauma or natural diseaseCommon morphologic variantsMetopic suture: Suture line extending between bregma, which is intersection of coronal and sagittal sutures and nasion; this suture is between left and right frontal bone and normally closes by 8 years of age; however, it can persist in some individualsSutural bones: Accessory ossicles that appear as island in suture; they can be found at numerous locations but commonly are lambda (intersection of lambdoid sutures and sagittal suture) or bregma or along course of sagittal sutureInca bone: Large bone at apex of occipital bone at lambda, which is due to failure of fusion of ossification centers in occipital bone and is associated with mendosal sutures on endocranial surface, which can be confused with inflicted injury in childMandibular torus: Bony ridge on lingual surface of mandibleSeptal aperture: Perforation of olecranon fossa to coronoid fossa of humerus, which can resemble gunshot woundIdentification of Postmortem ChangeGeneral considerationsPostmortem change can resemble trauma or natural diseasePostmortem change can fall into one of several categories: Weathering, discoloration, cut marks, rodent gnawing or carnivore scavenging, and cultural modificationWeathering produces cracking and splitting of outer surface of boneDiscoloration of bone can occur secondary to deposition in soil, thermal effects, and contact with metal objects; contact with oxidized copper, such as jacket of projectile, can produce light green discoloration of boneCut marks: If partially skeletonized remains need to be dismembered for final removal of soft tissue, careless use of scalpels and other sharp objects can mark skeletal remainsRodent gnawing: Rodents gnaw cortical bone to obtain minerals, including calcium; characteristic appearance are numerous parallel small grooves in bone at surfaceCarnivore scavenging: Carnivores will often chew on proximal and distal ends of long bones to retrieve bone marrow; gnawing can produce round puncture sites in surface of boneAncillary TestingObtaining Material for DNACortical bone and teeth can serve as source for DNACommon bones used are femur (shaft), tibia (shaft), or bones of footWhen taking fragment of shaft for DNA, it is best to not cut entirely through diameter of shaft and instead just cut down to marrow cavity and block out 2 cm or larger segment; this preserves integrity of shaft of bone (i.e., does not divide bone into 2 fragments)ReportingGeneral ConsiderationsReport of skeletal remains should include list of bones present, including their sidedness, estimation of sex, age at time of death, ancestry, and stature as well as identification of trauma (antemortem, perimortem, or postmortem), morphologic variants, natural disease, and postmortem changesAbility to include biological profile will depend upon skeletal remains present; e.g., with complete skeleton, estimation of sex, age at death, ancestry, and stature should be possible; however, if sternum is only bone present, ability to develop complete biological profile will be impaired"

carbon dioxide (CO₂)Masque ecchymotique: Intense head and neck edema and cyanosisRespiration: Production of energy needed for living species, typically with intake of O₂ and release of CO₂ in specialized organs, such as lungsVentilation: Environmental O₂ delivered to lungsGas exchange: Pulmonary O₂ diffuses to blood; CO₂  diffuses to exhaled airTransport: Oxygenated blood delivers O₂ to tissueCells uptake and use O₂ for metabolism and energy, then return CO₂  to bloodTypes of AsphyxiaChoking: Blockage of airway to prevent respirationBelow epiglottis (Sauvageau, 2010) or any internal blockage (Dolinak, 2005)Confined space: No exchange of O₂, reduced O₂ atmosphereExample: Refrigerator/freezer with closed doorCrucifixion: \"Exhaustion asphyxia:\" Slow loss of muscles for breathing and respiratory arrestStretching from arms prevents effective respirationWeight to feet eases respiration, increases painCycle repeats, increasing weakness, decreasing respirationDrowning: Liquid, usually water, blockage of nose and mouth or immersionEntrapment: Confinement to reduced O₂ environment or chest restrictionHanging: Force that compresses neck from full or partial weight of decedent's bodyJudicial hanging: Death by fracture of neckLigature strangulation: Force that compresses neck is applied by mechanism other than decedent's body weightManual strangulation: Force compressing neck comes from hands, forearms, or other limbsMechanical asphyxia: Restriction of chest movement causing ineffective respirationTraumatic and positional asphyxia are main categoriesPositional asphyxia: Restriction of chest movement is due to position of bodySmothering: Blockage of airway to prevent respirationAbove epiglottis (Sauvageau, 2010) or any external blockage (Dolinak, 2005)Snow immersion: Falling, crashing into snow, unable to extradite or breath airStrangulation: Impairment of blood supply by mechanical constriction of vesselsSuffocation: Broad term reflecting inability of O₂ to reach lungs for exchangeTraumatic asphyxia: Restriction of chest movement is due to heavy object pressing against chestVitiated atmosphere: Spoiled or impaired atmosphere

living species, typically with intake of O₂ and release of CO₂ in specialized organs, such as lungsVentilation: Environmental O₂ delivered to lungsGas exchange: Pulmonary O₂ diffuses to blood; CO₂  diffuses to exhaled airTransport: Oxygenated blood delivers O₂ to tissueCells uptake and use O₂ for metabolism and energy, then return CO₂  to bloodTypes of AsphyxiaChoking: Blockage of airway to prevent respirationBelow epiglottis (Sauvageau, 2010) or any internal blockage (Dolinak, 2005)Confined space: No exchange of O₂, reduced O₂ atmosphereExample: Refrigerator/freezer with closed doorCrucifixion: \"Exhaustion asphyxia:\" Slow loss of muscles for breathing and respiratory arrestStretching from arms prevents effective respirationWeight to feet eases respiration, increases painCycle repeats, increasing weakness, decreasing respirationDrowning: Liquid, usually water, blockage of nose and mouth or immersionEntrapment: Confinement to reduced O₂ environment or chest restrictionHanging: Force that compresses neck from full or partial weight of decedent's bodyJudicial hanging: Death by fracture of neckLigature strangulation: Force that compresses neck is applied by mechanism other than decedent's body weightManual strangulation: Force compressing neck comes from hands, forearms, or other limbsMechanical asphyxia: Restriction of chest movement causing ineffective respirationTraumatic and positional asphyxia are main categoriesPositional asphyxia: Restriction of chest movement is due to position of bodySmothering: Blockage of airway to prevent respirationAbove

in general, scene is law enforcement's responsibility; body is forensic pathologist's responsibilityBlood patterns on floor important for site of injury and activity after firearm injuryNote location of projectiles, spent cartridges, sites of ricochet, and intermediary targetsNote any evidence of body movement during or after eventEvidence ConsiderationPhotograph and collect fragile evidence at sceneConsider collection or testing of clothing for gunshot residue at seenAssessment of any firearm present: Loaded, fired, blood, positionCommunicationCrucial to work as team, understand roles and dutiesIn general, forensic pathologist controls body, law enforcement controls sceneWill vary by jurisdiction; understanding of roles is importantMake introductions, get cards/contacts, share reportsClear understanding of who is responsible for various aspects of scene, evidence collection, interviews, etc.Keep family informed unless contradicted by specific aspects of caseBallistic Evidence at Scene and BodyCareful examination of body at scene and autopsy may identify evidence, clues to position, shooter, etc.Hands and feet may have soot or ballistic evidenceWith suspected suicides, always assure shot could have been fired by decedentExamine clothing for ballistic evidenceCoordinate with ballistic examiner for optimal handlingMay require testing at scene or removal prior to transportGeneral Autopsy ConsiderationsWound BallisticsProjectiles produce permanent and temporary cavities; each will vary with ammunition, weapon, and tissuePermanent cavity: Actual physical area destroyed by projectileTemporary cavity: Area of energy transfer and tissue injury; larger than permanent wound trackMost important factor in tissue woundingRadial expansion as projectile passes; collapses following passageSize and shape varies with tissue, ammunition, and weaponDepends on kinetic energy (KE), rate of energy lost, elasticity and cohesiveness of tissueElastic tissue most resistant to damage by temporary cavityKEMass and velocity of bullet determine KE at impact (KE = 1/2 x M x V²)Severity of injury depends on energy transferred, not energy availableBullet yaw causes greater loss of KE (by square of yaw)Expanding bullets (nonjacketed, hollow nose, some specialty loads) travel more slowly through body causing greater transfer of KE and greater destructionTissue Differences in Ballistic InjuryDense tissue slows bullet, increases damage; elastic tissue with least damageExtremitiesTraumatic amputation of fingers and toes possibleProjectile may reenter body when it exits extremity; determines extremity position relative to bodyBrainFusiform tract lined by macerated tissue with disrupted brain, blood clots, and bone spiculesConfluent and focal petechial hemorrhages, microvascular disruptionDamaged area greater than projectile due to good force transmission and loss of KEIncreased trauma if ventricles hitProjectile may fragment, deflect off skull, or enter ventricles/large vessels, producing atypical courseGastrointestinal tractBleeding may be subserosal, muscular, submucosal, or intraluminalBacterial and chemical peritonitis may result from perforations and lead to delayed deathHigh-velocity projectiles may produce extensive lacerations if area is full when struck, more extensive with liquid contentsPancreasHemorrhage and fat necrosisTraumatic pancreatitis may be cause of delayed deathSpleenRagged, capsular lacerationProfuse, rapid hemorrhageLiver and kidneyUsually ragged, irregular perforationsStellar entrance wounds usually larger than in skin and larger than projectileHemorrhage (peritoneal for liver; retroperitoneal for kidney) may cause deathMicroscopic evidence of damage in adjacent tissueAbscess formation, especially anaerobic, common in survivors; may be cause of delayed deathLung and respiratory systemLeast damaged organ due to elastic fibers, low water content in lungPermanent path of tissue destruction may be smaller than projectile diameterProjectiles may be caught in bronchial tree, then coughed from body or coughed to another part of bronchial treeHeart and aortaFatal injury from tamponade, vascular disruption, papillary muscle or valve damage, myocardial disruption, arrhythmiasLow velocity: Slit-shaped; high velocity with extensive lacerations or explosive injuryMore damage during diastole or with congestive heart failure (heart filled with blood; more transmission of KE)Elasticity of left ventricle and aorta tends to decrease wound size; low-velocity wounds to left ventricle may seal off, prolonging survivalGunshot wound to head may produce air embolus to heart (empty heart sign) with little or no blood in heartHollow organsFluid-filled organs transmit KE in all directions, leading to expansion and significant loss of KEOrgans, such as heart, full stomach or bladder, or lateral ventricles may have explosive expansions and fragmentationSkin and vesselsProjectiles often stop just under skin, partially exit or in clothing after exitingProjectiles may perforate elastic vessel and fail to exit, embolizing with gravity or blood flowLarger elastic arteries may have less damage than surrounding tissue or, if perforated, cause significant hemorrhageBone Fractures From Ballistic InjuryBone fractures: General considerationsSoot and powder common on bone fragment edges in contact woundsLow-velocity bullets impacting long bones tend to stop or deflect projectilesHigh-velocity projectiles in long bones tend to produce comminuted fractures with small bone fragments acting as secondary projectilesExit fractures have primary beveling, smaller secondary radiating fractures, and fewer arcs if concentric heaving fractures presentExit radiating fractures will not cross entrance radiating fracturesBeveling in concentric heaving fractures same with entrance and exit fracturesTypes of bone fractures in skullBeveling (shelving) in flat bones (primary skull fracture)Defect in skull by passing projectileAllows directional assessment;

each will vary with ammunition, weapon, and tissuePermanent cavity: Actual physical area destroyed by projectileTemporary cavity: Area of energy transfer and tissue injury; larger than permanent wound trackMost important factor in tissue woundingRadial expansion as projectile passes; collapses following passageSize and shape varies with tissue, ammunition, and weaponDepends on kinetic energy (KE), rate of energy lost, elasticity and cohesiveness of tissueElastic tissue most resistant to damage by temporary cavityKEMass and velocity of bullet determine KE at impact (KE = 1/2 x M x V²)Severity of injury depends on energy transferred, not energy availableBullet yaw causes greater loss of KE (by square of yaw)Expanding bullets (nonjacketed, hollow nose, some specialty loads) travel more slowly through body causing greater transfer of KE and greater destructionTissue Differences in Ballistic InjuryDense tissue slows bullet, increases damage; elastic tissue with least damageExtremitiesTraumatic amputation of fingers and toes possibleProjectile may reenter body when it exits extremity; determines extremity position relative to bodyBrainFusiform tract lined by macerated tissue with disrupted brain, blood clots, and bone spiculesConfluent and focal petechial hemorrhages, microvascular disruptionDamaged area greater than projectile due to good force transmission and loss of KEIncreased trauma if ventricles hitProjectile may fragment, deflect off skull, or enter ventricles/large vessels, producing atypical courseGastrointestinal tractBleeding may be subserosal, muscular, submucosal, or intraluminalBacterial and chemical peritonitis may result from perforations and lead to delayed deathHigh-velocity projectiles may produce extensive lacerations if area is full when struck, more extensive with liquid contentsPancreasHemorrhage and fat necrosisTraumatic pancreatitis may be cause of delayed deathSpleenRagged, capsular lacerationProfuse, rapid hemorrhageLiver and kidneyUsually ragged, irregular perforationsStellar entrance wounds usually larger than in skin and larger than projectileHemorrhage (peritoneal for liver; retroperitoneal for kidney) may cause deathMicroscopic evidence of damage in adjacent tissueAbscess formation, especially anaerobic, common in survivors; may be cause of delayed deathLung and respiratory systemLeast damaged organ due to elastic fibers, low water content in lungPermanent path of tissue destruction may be smaller than projectile diameterProjectiles may be caught in bronchial tree, then coughed from body or coughed to another part of bronchial treeHeart and aortaFatal injury from tamponade, vascular disruption, papillary muscle or valve damage, myocardial disruption, arrhythmiasLow velocity: Slit-shaped; high velocity with extensive lacerations or explosive injuryMore damage during diastole or with congestive heart failure (heart filled with blood; more transmission of KE)Elasticity of left ventricle and aorta tends to decrease wound size; low-velocity wounds to left ventricle may seal off, prolonging survivalGunshot wound to head may produce air embolus to heart (empty heart sign) with little or no blood in heartHollow organsFluid-filled organs transmit KE in all directions, leading to expansion and significant loss of KEOrgans, such as heart, full stomach or bladder, or lateral ventricles may have explosive expansions and fragmentationSkin and vesselsProjectiles often stop just under skin, partially exit or in clothing after exitingProjectiles may perforate elastic vessel and fail to exit, embolizing with gravity or blood flowLarger elastic arteries may have less damage than surrounding tissue or, if perforated, cause significant hemorrhageBone Fractures From Ballistic InjuryBone fractures: General considerationsSoot and powder common on bone fragment edges in contact woundsLow-velocity bullets impacting long bones tend to stop or deflect projectilesHigh-velocity projectiles in long bones tend to produce comminuted fractures with small bone fragments acting as secondary projectilesExit fractures have primary beveling, smaller secondary radiating fractures, and fewer arcs if concentric heaving fractures presentExit radiating fractures will not cross entrance radiating fracturesBeveling in concentric heaving fractures same with entrance and exit fracturesTypes of bone fractures in skullBeveling (shelving) in flat bones (primary skull fracture)Defect in skull by passing projectileAllows directional assessment;

with enclosed or rapid (flash) fires, inhalation of superheated air or oxygen-deficient air may be sufficient to cause deathHistologyMicroscopic examination of tracheal mucosa or deeper lung sections may be useful in documenting presence of soot;

accelerants are commonly usedHomicides may involve death from other injury classifications (e.g., strangulation, stab wounds, gunshot wounds), with fire being set to disguise deathIn complex cases, it is advisable to wait for fire investigative report before final determination is madeWhile presence of soot in lower airways indicates decedent was breathing during fire, absence of soot in lower airways is not proof decedent was deceased before fire beganIt is not necessary to distinguish 1st- from 2nd- from 3rd-degree burns in autopsy report; nor is it necessary to provide calculation of total body surface area involvement (antemortem estimates from medical record may be used); rather, injuries should be measured and thoroughly described;

arms are flexed as in fighting stance)Pugilistic posturing may occur regardless of whether decedent was alive or dead at time of firePostmortem \"heat hematomas\" may involve epidural space, mimicking antemortem epidural hemorrhageArtifactual (\"heat\") hematomas have chocolate-brown colorationPostmortem hematomas are associated with charring of overlying calvarium; postmortem fracturing may also be presentPostmortem hematomas have CO levels similar to blood from other regions of bodyArtifactual subdural hemorrhages are not known to occurHeat of fire may cause additional spurious injuries that can be confused with antemortem injuries, includingSkin slippageSkin splittingHeat fractures of boneAbsence of hands or feetBlistering of skin can occur postmortemBlistering does not indicate decedent was alive at time of fireAncillary TestingRadiographsIn cases of extensive injury &/or charring, full-body radiographs should be used to search for foreign projectilesIn unidentified decedents, full-body radiographs may assist in locating prosthetic or implanted medical devices, such as orthopedic hardwareRadiographs are also component of dental examinationToxicologyTesting for drugs and alcohol is essential in work-up of fire deathsIn cases in which blood is not available, skeletal muscle can be submitted for testingCO TestingBlood sample should be submitted for CO testingIf death is solely result of CO toxicity, results are typically greater than 40%With additional considerations (e.g., natural disease, age, additional injuries), CO levels may be lower (in range of 25%)While CO levels of 5-10% may indicate that the person was breathing during fire, it must be remembered that tobacco smokers commonly have baseline CO levels as high as 10%Absence of CO cannot be used alone to establish that a person was dead before fire; with enclosed or rapid (flash) fires, inhalation of superheated air or oxygen-deficient air may be sufficient to cause deathHistologyMicroscopic examination of tracheal mucosa or deeper lung sections may be useful in documenting presence of soot; soot will appear as dark carbonaceous debris coating epithelium of airwaysMicroscopic sections of thermally damaged skin may show characteristic epidermal nuclear streamingPresence of inflammatory reaction involving skin wounds may be useful in categorizing wounds as antemortem; however, absence of inflammatory reaction has been documented in decedents who survived for several days after their injuriesReportingGeneral ConsiderationsKey considerations in fire-related deaths include identification of body, and determination of manner of deathMajority of cases are accidentsFollowing natural death, fire may originate due to hazards at sceneSuicidal deaths are referred to as self-immolation; accelerants are commonly usedHomicides may involve death from other injury classifications (e.g., strangulation, stab wounds, gunshot wounds), with fire being set to disguise deathIn complex cases, it is advisable to wait for fire investigative report before final determination is madeWhile presence of soot in lower airways indicates decedent was breathing during fire, absence of soot in lower airways is not proof decedent was deceased before fire beganIt is not necessary to distinguish 1st- from 2nd- from 3rd-degree burns in autopsy report; nor is it necessary to provide calculation of total body surface area involvement (antemortem estimates from medical record may be used); rather, injuries should be measured and thoroughly described; photographs with long rulers may be useful"

mellitusHypertensionObesityHyperlipidemiaClinically significant atherosclerotic occlusions are frequently identified within proximal aspect of LAD or LCA, or anywhere along RCAFixed occlusions causing < 70% luminal area narrowing are often considered as asymptomaticFixed occlusions causing > 70% luminal area narrowing are often symptomatic with increased cardiac demandFixed occlusions causing > 90% luminal area narrowing may be symptomatic at restGenerally accepted that for single-vessel involvement, lesions with 75% luminal area narrowing can cause sudden cardiac deathMyocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death are frequently result of acute plaque change (i.e., intraluminal thrombus formation upon site of plaque rupture)In cases of acute thrombosis causing sudden cardiac death, majority of underlying atherosclerotic lesions were asymptomatic prior to plaque rupture and thrombus formationAdrenergic stimulation can predispose vulnerable plaques to rupture (intense emotional stress is associated with development of acute MI)Hypertensive Cardiovascular DiseaseMost hypertensive patients have idiopathic (essential) hypertensionSmall percentage of patients have hypertension due to

AD 130-210)Best known for his systemization and innovation of Hippocratic medical traditionStudied anatomy principally through dissection and vivisection of animals (pigs and apes)Credited as 1st to correlate patient complaints and symptoms with what was found upon examination of affected area of deceasedHis written masterpiece, On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body, was based on humoral theory (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) and dominated medical thought for centuriesRomansAutopsy of Julius Caesar (March 44 BC) is recognized as earliest recorded autopsy report in historyPhysician Antistius offered opinion that of 23 stab wounds, none were fatal except for wound to breastAntistius' report gave rise to Latin term forensics, meaning \"before the forum\" (where Antistius delivered his opinion)Justinian enactments (529-564)Provided for regulation of practice of medicineRequired proof of competence by means of examinationImposed penalties for malpracticeCharacterized function of medical expert as assisting judiciary by impartial interpretation and opinion based on specialized knowledgeRegarded as highest point of achievement in forensic medicine in ancient worldMiddle Ages and RenaissanceEast AsiaIn 6th century, Chinese physician Chich-ts'si wrote 1st known treatise on forensic medicineDuring Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392), published texts on forensic medicine were in useIn 1247, Song Ci edited classic Chinese text on death investigation (Xi-Yuan-Lu, or Records for Washing Away of Wrong Cases)Emphasized role of officers investigating deaths, rather than that of medical practitionersRecognized as world's 1st systemic handbook for postmortem examinationsEventually translated into numerous languagesCovered findings in cases of infanticide, drowning, hanging, poisoning, and assaultEuropeReports from 4th and 10th centuries indicate that autopsies were being performed on corpses of criminalsIn late Middle Ages, 1st recorded autopsies were performed chiefly to identify causes of suspicious deathsBy Renaissance, predominant purpose of autopsy was for anatomic dissectionRenaissance is referred to as \"golden age of anatomy\"Andreas Vesalius published De Humani Corporis Fabrica in 1543, the founding text of modern anatomyIn EnglandCoroners were formalized in 1194 by Richard the Lionhearted's Articles of EyreProvided for custos placitorum coronae (keepers of pleas of crown, or coroners)Coroner duties included holding inquests, valuing objects for taxation, obtaining arrest warrants, and ensuring that potential murders were investigatedIn ItalyPope Innocent III provided for appointment of doctors to courts for determination of wounds in 1209In 1231, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II issued decree mandating that 1 human body should be dissected at least once every 5 years for anatomic studies at SalernoIn 1249, Hugo de Lucca took oath as medicolegal expertHuman dissections between 1266 and 1275 were of probable medicolegal natureUniversity of Bologna was largely controlled by law facultyAutopsies were likely solicited to solve legal problems, rather than to promote medical knowledgeClearly recorded case of autopsy for purpose of investigating cause of death dates to 1286In 1302, judge in Bologna ordered autopsy of nobleman who had died under suspicious circumstancesAntipope Alexander V was autopsied in 1410 to investigate possibility of poisoningPhysician Fortunato FedeleMade career of performing autopsies and testifying in courtPublished book on forensic medicine (De Relationes

(1510-1590)Considered the 1st forensic pathologistWrote on traumatic injuries of organsModern HistoryEast AsiaDuring Japan's Edo period (1603-1868)Coroner investigations were mandatory for cases involving death and unusual incidentsOfficials who investigated scenes were known as kenshi (\"coroners\")EuropeIn EnglandIn 1788, Samuel Farr wrote Elements of Medical Jurisprudence, which contained descriptions of findings required for judgment by coroners and courts of law in cases, including rape and murderIn 1789, Andrew Duncan began lecturing on legal medicine and public healthChair of Forensic Medicine was established at University of Edinburgh in 1803In ItalyIn 1761, anatomist Giovanni Morgagni published De Sedibus based on observations from hundreds of autopsy dissectionsCredited with establishing concept of clinical-pathologic correlationIn Germany and Austria1st known medicolegal clinic established in Vienna ~ 1830 (and 2nd one in Berlin in 1833)Carl von Rokitansky performed 30,000 autopsies at Second Vienna Medical SchoolBasics of modern autopsy techniques were developed by Friedrich Zenker (1825-1898) and Rudolph Virchow (1821-1902)In France1st professional Chair in Legal Medicine established in 1794In 1803, provision required judges to appoint medical experts who were graduates in medicine and had passed examination in legal medicine1st medicolegal clinic established in 1840AmericaColonists brought English coroner system to America1st recorded coroner's inquest in America occurred in 1635 (Plymouth Colony)As early as 1636, role of coroner transitioned from appointed to elected positionBy late 17th century, coroner's autopsies were on record (including a 1691 autopsy of a New York governor presumed to have been poisoned)Dr. J. S. Stringham began lecturing on legal medicine in New York around 1804In 1813, first Chair of Medical Jurisprudence established in New York CityIn 1860, Maryland law enabled coroner to require presence of physician at inquestsIn 1868, physician was appointed coroner of BaltimoreIn 1877, \"medical examiners\" replaced coroners in Massachusetts; first official use of termIn 1890, physicians performing autopsies for coroners in Baltimore are referred to as \"medical examiners\"New York City established 1st true medical examiner system in 1918, replacing their coroner's officeIn 1939, Maryland establishes 1st state medical examiner officeIn 1959, American Board of Pathology began to offer board certification in forensic pathologyNational Association of Medical Examiners (NAME) established in 1966",

examination of bodyInternal examination of bodyConsideration of ancillary proceduresGeneration of autopsy reportDespite similarities, fundamental differences exist in regards to performance of hospital and forensic autopsiesImportant to understand distinctions so that any particular case may successfully satisfy aimPersonnel and SettingPerformance of hospital autopsy is not limited to hospital pathologist, nor is forensic autopsy restricted to forensic pathologistIn some locales, forensic autopsies are routinely performed by hospital pathologists in hospital settingsNot uncommon for forensic pathologists to perform hospital autopsies at county or state facilities via contractual arrangementsAlternative autopsy settings may includePrivately owned facilitiesAcademic centersFuneral homesRecognize that general proficiency in hospital autopsy does not equate to equal competency in forensic pathologyHospital pathologist performing forensic autopsies should be cognizant and cautious of those cases requiring additional forensic expertiseAuthorization for ExaminationHospital autopsiesAre only performed with signed consent (i.e., permission) of legal next of kinEstablished order of legal next of kin must be verified with one's institution &/or local statutes, but general guidelines (in descending order) areSpouseAdult childParentSiblingAdditional relativesForensic autopsiesDo not require consent of legal next of kinAre performed on basis of legal jurisdiction governing operation of medical examiner or coroner offices, as mandated by local or state statutesDepending on state law, jurisdiction over death belongs either to location (i.e., county) where death is pronounced, or to injury that occurred and precipitated deathMay be subject to religious objectionIn several states, statutes allow family members to express religious objection to autopsyReligious objections may be subject to court reviewExtent of ExaminationHospital autopsiesAre subject to limitations (restrictions) as decreed by consenting next of kinRestrictions are indicated on autopsy consent formMost common restriction is to exclude examination of brainIf no

                "raw_text": "TERMINOLOGYSynonymsBell mania, acute exhaustive mania, agitated mania, and fatal catatoniaDefinitionsDelirium is syndrome of cognitive disturbances characterized by alterations in consciousness, orientation, memory, thought, and behaviorExcited delirium is delirium characterized by agitation, aggressive or violent behaviorExcited delirium syndrome is sudden death of person following period of excited delirium for which autopsy does not disclose evidence of sufficient trauma or natural disease to otherwise explain deathOVERVIEWGeneral ConsiderationsDelirium is state of acute disturbance in cognition and consciousnessGeneral features includeDisorientation to space and timeDisorganized thought processesDisorganized speechHallucinationsExcited delirium is delirium involving violent behaviorExcited delirium was first described as Bell mania by Dr. Luther Bell in 1849Potentially fatal form of delirium in mentally ill patientsPatients presented with fever, agitation, and inability to sleepViolent behaviors often necessitated physical restraintSymptoms persisted over chronic course (days to months), with death usually occurring after several weeks Reports of fatal cases of Bell mania dissipated in 1950s with introduction of phenothiazinesAcute form of excited delirium was described in 1980s in association with illicit stimulants (e.g., cocaine and methamphetamine)Follows characteristic sequence of eventsDelirium with agitation (e.g., fear, panic, and violent, bizarre, or hyperactive behaviors)Struggle with physical restraintSudden cessation of struggleCardiorespiratory arrest and deathDiffers from Bell mania in thatCases strongly associated with stimulant drug use Death occurs within minutes to hours of symptom onsetCLINICAL ISSUESCase Presentation In its present form, excited delirium syndrome is strongly associated with abuse of illegal stimulantsMost commonly cocaine or methamphetamineRarely phencyclidine (PCP)Most patients are male, and majority do not have underlying mental illnessCases involving patients with underlying mental illness do occur but are less frequent On initial assessment, it is difficult (if not impossible) to distinguish cases of excited delirium due to stimulant abuse from excited delirium due to mental illnessMajority of cases are associated with displays of unexpected strength &/or hyperthermiaDeath invariably occurs within minutes to hours after struggle with police or medical personnel involving use of physical restraints Excited delirium syndrome is acute condition, in contrast to chronic nature of Bell maniaDeath is characterized by cardiopulmonary arrest resistant to cardiopulmonary resuscitative efforts Mechanism of Disease and DeathExcited delirium syndrome is associated with activation of sympathetic nervous system, notably with elevated levels of dopaminePsychostimulants (e.g., cocaine and methamphetamine) increase synaptic levels of dopamine Chronic cocaine use normally leads to compensatory upregulation in dopamine transporters (which aids to clear excessive dopamine from synapses) It is theorized with excited delirium syndrome, there is failure of upregulation of dopamine transporters, and resultant excessive dopamine signaling (i.e., functional hyperdopaminergia) triggers delirium and precipitates autonomic dysfunctionHyperadrenergic state may then cause cardiac dysrhythmia, accounting for fatal outcomesHypothalamic dopamine receptors control thermoregulation, and thus dopamine dysregulation may further account for profound hyperthermia characteristic of excited delirium Means and nature of physical restraint may alternatively suggest death due to positional or traumatic asphyxia Assertion of positional or traumatic asphyxia must be weighed against known case circumstances and published scientific data regarding practicality of restraint-induced hypoxia INVESTIGATIVE CONSIDERATIONSScene InvestigationsComplete and thorough scene investigation is of paramount importance, to include detailed photographic documentationDiagnosis of excited delirium syndrome is largely dependent on investigative circumstances Police reports, emergency medical service reports, and witness statements should all be collected and reviewed In unwitnessed cases, attempts at self-cooling (placement of cold towels, immersion in water) may signify hyperthermiaHyperthermia is important hallmark of excited delirium syndrome and is regarded as harbinger of death Medical Records Past medical records should be collectedMedication list should be reviewed, with attention to drugs with known cardiotoxic effects (e.g., QT prolongation)Clinical features of excited delirium syndrome includeAcute mental status changeAgitationAdrenergic dysfunctionTachycardiaTachypneaHyperthermia DiaphoresisNoncompliance (with police or medical personnel) Increased pain tolerance and unusual strengthAbundant energy and lack of fatigue If there is cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation and ensuing prolonged survival, patients may also develop RhabdomyolysisAcute renal failureDisseminated intravascular coagulation AUTOPSY FINDINGSGeneral ConsiderationsUseful approach to autopsy in cases of suspected excited delirium syndrome is to identify or exclude other intervening injuries or diseases Reported cases of excited delirium syndrome are often associated with significant natural disease (e.g., atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease) that is felt to be contributory to death by making individuals more susceptible to fatal cardiac dysrhythmiaIn other instances, autopsy findings may be minimal External Examination By definition, discovered injuries (e.g., abrasions, contusions) are minorDocument with photography to include pertinent negative findings Internal Examination Complete autopsy should be performed Perform anterior neck dissectionCut-downs of torso and extremities should be considered ANCILLARY TESTINGToxicologyToxicology testing is fundamental step in evaluation of excited delirium syndromeRequest and analyze hospital admission blood samples, if applicable and available Samples should be collected from multiples sources (e.g., peripheral blood, vitreous, urine, &/or bile)Vast majority of cases of excited delirium syndrome will be positive for illicit stimulants, either cocaine or methamphetamine Other reported drugs include PCP, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), cathinones (bath salts), and prescription psychiatric medicationsHistologyHistologic evaluation of organs is important step in properly excluding presence of natural diseaseSample and evaluate cardiac conduction system (e.g., sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes)OtherConsider retention of brain or brain slices, and neuropathology consultation, depending on individual case circumstancesConsider genetic testing for conduction system abnormalities, depending on individual case circumstances Elevations in levels of brain heat shock proteins [i.e., heat shock protein 70 (hsp70)] have been reportedBiomarker of hyperthermiaREPORTINGDeath CertificationDeterminations of cause and manner of death in cases of suspected excited delirium syndrome may have implications regarding allegations of police misconduct or brutality Due to common negative findings (i.e., lack of identifiable injuries), allegations of \"cover-ups\" are not infrequent Rulings should not be issued until ancillary testing has been completed, and all pertinent records have been collected and reviewedDue consideration must be given to alternative intervening causes (e.g., neck or chest compression, blunt force injuries, or significant natural disease) Cause of death statements may be descriptive (e.g., \"cardiac dysrhythmia complicating struggle with physical restraint in a person under the influence of methamphetamine\") Given contribution of physical struggle, manner of death is best classified as either homicide or

therefore, just removing remains and sending bones to anthropologist is not best practice, having anthropologist present, if possible, when remains are unearthed is bestAs with position of remains in ground providing information, so can pattern of surface scatter when bones are found above ground, and once again, having anthropologist present for recovery of remains is bestAutopsyDetermination of Human vs. Nonhuman RemainsGeneral considerationsMost common type of bone brought to law enforcement, coroners, medical examiners, or forensic pathologists is nonhuman boneMost nonhuman bones have same name as their human counterpart, with one exception being astragalus, which is nonhuman equivalent of talusMost nonhuman bones have similar structure to their human counterpart, thus serving as potential concern when found by publicAlthough nonhuman bones have similar structure to their human counterpart, some are fused or incompleteIn animals, radius and ulna are often fusedIn animals, fibula is often incomplete with small fragment of proximal fibula present and fused with tibiaBooks and other resources are available (e.g., wildlife education programs at college) for identification of genus and species if so desiredComparison with human skeleton will easily allow for separation of human from nonhumanCommon species encountered by publicDeer, in both urban and rural environmentsMany others, including pigs, bears, dogs, horses, cattle, and birds (e.g., blue herons, chickens)Common nonhuman bones encountered by public and brought to law enforcement or other investigating agencyBear paws, either forepaw or hindpawBear paws are often discarded after processing of bear hide, and these discarded paws can be found by publicDecomposed bear paw closely resembles human hand or footX-ray of bear paw will reveal numerous sesamoid bones (in additional to other differences), which can easily allow for determination that found remains are nonhumanMetapodials, which is generalized term for both metacarpals and metatarsalsAt distal end of metapodial is pulley-like structure with 2 raised ridges for articulation with proximal phalanges; no human bone has similar-appearing structureFemur and tibiaIn deer, in addition to other features, tibial tuberosity projects more than in humans and femoral neck is shorter and less prominent than humansRibs and vertebraeIn deer, vertebrae tend to have longer transverse and spinous processes than humansAtlas and axis are much larger (i.e., less delicate) than in humansRibs from deer are straighter than human ribs, as trunk of animal is directed downwardCalcaneus and astragalusCranium and mandible; however, given characteristic different appearance from human, these bones are rarely brought in by public with concerns that they are humanDevelopment of Biological Profile From Human Skeletal RemainsGeneral considerationsWhen assessing skeletal remains for sex, ancestry, age of individual at time of death, and stature, forensic anthropologist is making estimation as to those featuresWhen using biological profile developed by forensic anthropologist, that individual is different sex or ancestry or of different stature or age at time of death must be always be considered by those using that biological profile in their investigation (e.g., law enforcement)Determination of sex of individualGeneral considerations3 main bones used to determine sex of individual: Os coxae, cranium, and long bones, specifically diameter of femoral &/or humeral headNumerous articles exist for using wide range of other bones to determine sexFeatures of os coxaeConsidered bone that can most accurately estimate sex of individualPhenice criteria for determination of sex from pelvisVentral arc: Present in females, absent in malesIschiopubic ramus: Ridge on medial aspect in females, broad in malesSubpubic concavity: Present in females, absent in malesOther features to help distinguish male from femaleShape of greater sciatic notch: Narrow in females, broad in malesOverall shape of pelvis: Broader in females, narrower in malesPreauricular sulcus: More commonly present in females than malesFeatures of craniumAlthough not as definitive as pelvic traits, cranial traits often allow for accurate estimation of sex5 features to predict sex from craniumNuchal crest (and external occipital protuberance): Well-developed in males, less well-developed in femalesMastoid process: Larger in males, smaller in femalesSupraorbital margin: Thick and rounded in males, thinner and sharp in femalesGlabella: More prominent and projecting forward in males, flatter and less projection forward in femalesMental eminence: Prominent in males, less prominent in femalesComparison of cranium and mandible being examined to reference diagram will assist in assigning score to each of above 5 traits, which will allow for estimation of male vs. femaleFeatures of long bonesFemoral and humeral head diameter can be used to estimate male vs. female sexDetermination of age of individual at time of deathGeneral considerationsDetermination for subadults is based upon physiologic process (i.e., timing of closure of growth plates) and is fairly consistentDetermination for adults is based upon degenerative processes (i.e., wear and tear on bone) and is inconsistentEpiphyseal closure to determine age at time of deathBones are examined for epiphyses and whether they are not fused to diaphysis (i.e., open), partially fused (i.e., partial union), or completely fused (i.e., complete union)Timing of growth plate closure varies throughout body, and because of this variance, numerous locations can be assessed and general age at time of death determinedCompared to determination of age at time of death of adult, examination of skeletal system and assessment of closure of growth plates in subadult provides for relatively accurate assessmentDentition: In subadult, x-rays of maxilla and mandible allows for assessment of eruption of teeth; comparison with standard charts allows for prediction of age at time of death based upon eruption pattern presentFeatures of pubic symphysis to determine age at time of deathOf all methods, assessment of morphologic features of pubic symphysis to estimate age of individual at time of death is considered most reliableSuchey-Brooks and Todd scoring systems are most commonly usedVisual assessment of face of pubic symphysis for billows, development of ventral rampart, dorsal plateau, and superior and inferior extremities is performed to assign pubic symphysis to 1 of 5 stages (Suchey-Brooks) or 1 of 10 stages (Todd); stages have established range for age at time of death associated with eachCollections of casts for comparison are availableFeatures of auricular surface to determine age at time of deathAuricular surface is location at which os coxae articulates with sacrumApex, superior and inferior demiface, and retroauricular area are assessed for billowing, granularity, density, and porosity and assigned to 1 of 8 stages; each stage has age range associated with itFeatures of rib ends to determine age at time of deathEstimation of age at time of death using rib ends is preferably done with 4th ribVisual assessment of articular surface with presence or absence of billowing, depth and shape of pit, and wall of pit with presence or absence of scalloping and presence or absence of bony projections is made and rib assigned to 1 of 8 phases; each phase has age range associated with itFeatures of cranial sutures to determine age at time of deathGenerally considered one of least reliable methods for estimating age at time of deathCranial sutures are assessed as to whether they are open, minimally closed, significantly closed, or obliteratedNumerous locations on ectocranium (vault and lateral-anterior), palate, and, if accessible, endocranium are assessed; each location is assigned score, and total score allows for prediction of age at time of deathDetermination of ancestry of individualGeneral considerationsEstimation of ancestry is most often based upon features of cranium and mandibleEstimation of ancestry can be made both upon morphologic features as well as cranial measurementsFordisc 3.0 is program used by anthropologists to determine ancestry based upon cranial measurementsAncestry of living individual is often at least in part social construct, which is not necessarily representative of their biological structure; thus, assessment of biologic structure for ancestry may lead to erroneous conclusions as to how living individual's ancestry was representedNative Americans share similar morphologic traits with AsiansFeatures of cranium often used for estimation of ancestryNasal bone contour: Varies from low and rounded to steepled with no superior surface plateauLow and rounded nasal bone contour is more frequently associated with individuals of African ancestrySteepled nasal bone contour is more frequently associated with individuals of European ancestryNasal aperture width: Varying from narrow to wideNarrow nasal aperture is more frequently associated with European ancestryWide nasal aperture is more frequently associated with African ancestryAnterior nasal spine: Varies from short to longShort anterior nasal spine is more frequently associated with African ancestryLong anterior nasal spine is more frequently associated with European ancestryInferior nasal margin: Varies from guttered to sillGuttered, or gradual sloping, of inferior nasal margin is more frequently associated with African ancestrySill or prominent ridge between nasal floor and maxilla is more frequently associated with European ancestryNasal overgrowth: Either absent or presentAbsent nasal overgrowth is more frequently associated with European ancestryNasal overgrowth is more frequently associated with African ancestrySupranasal suture: Varies from absent to closed, but can be visible Zygomatic projection: Zygomatic bone is either retreating or projectingRetreating zygomatic bone is more frequently associated with European or African ancestryProjecting zygomatic bone is more frequently associated with Asian ancestryMalar tubercle: Varies from absent to present with incipient and trace as intermediary categoriesAbsent malar tubercle is more frequently associated with African ancestryTrace malar tubercle is more frequently associated with European ancestryInterorbital breadth: Varies from narrow to wideNarrow interorbital breadth is more frequently associated with European ancestryWide interorbital breadth is more frequently associated with African ancestryZygomaxillary suture: Forms include smooth, angled, and S-shapedSmooth zygomaxillary suture is more frequently associated with African ancestryAngled zygomaxillary suture is more frequently associated with Asian ancestryS-shaped (or zigzag) zygomaxillary suture is more frequently associated with European ancestryAlveolar prognathism: Either orthognathic (flat midfacial profile) or prognathic (projecting midfacial profile)Orthognathic is more frequently associated with European or Asian ancestryPrognathic is more frequently associated with European ancestryTransverse palatine suture has several formsStraight and symmetrical: Associated with Asian ancestryAnterior bulging: Associated with African ancestryAnterior and posterior deviation of suture at midline: Associated with European ancestryMandibular torus: Present or absentPresent mandibular torus is more frequently associated with Asian ancestryAbsent mandibular torus is more frequently associated with European or African ancestryPalatine torus: Present or absentPresent palatine torus is more frequently associated with Asian ancestryAbsent mandibular torus is more frequently associated with European or African ancestryPostbregmatic depression: Present or absentPresent postbregmatic depression is more frequently associated with African ancestryAbsent postbregmatic depression is more frequently associated with European or Asian ancestryIn addition to above listed features, other morphologic features that may assist in estimation of ancestry are described in various books and articlesDentition can assist in estimation of ancestry; shoveled incisors are associated with Asian or Native American ancestryDetermination of stature of individualStature determinations are made by measurement of long bone and using that measurement in formula, which is often based upon sex and ancestry of individualFordisc 3.0 will provide stature estimations based upon measurements of long bones entered into programIdentification of TraumaGeneral features in determination of antemortem, perimortem, and postmortem traumaAntemortem trauma is identified by having reaction to trauma (i.e., callus formation, or subsequent evidence of healing of bone)Postmortem trauma often has different coloration of edge of fracture compared to adjacent cortical surface (e.g., when shovel strikes bone that has been in ground, it can break bone and expose white surface of newly exposed bone at fracture line, whereas adjacent cortex, having been exposed to soil for some time, is brown)Perimortem fractures lack features that allow for identification as antemortem or postmortemDistinction between perimortem trauma and postmortem trauma can be very difficultDetermination of perimortem trauma does not indicate that trauma occurred at time of death, only that it occurred around time of deathSome features of antemortem traumaRounded edges and callus formation; pseudoarthrosesSome features of postmortem traumaSharp edgesDifferent coloration between fracture edge and adjacent cortical surface of boneSome fracture types (e.g., longitudinal fractures extending along length of bone shaft) are more frequently found postmortem than antemortem or perimortemGeneral fracture conceptsBone is viscoelastic substance, and, as such, responds differently to different forces: When force is applied rapidly, such as gunshot wound, ↑ in stress (force/area) is much greater than ↑ in strain (new length/original length) and bone response is similar to glass and shatters Bone fragments created by gunshot wound can be reapproximated and glued back together into intact bone with its normal shape; when force is applied more slowly, such as blunt force trauma in beating with baseball bat, ↑ in strain is much greater than ↑ in stress and bone response is more like rubber in that bone bends; however, this bending reaches point where it does not reverse (i.e., plastic deformation) and then where it finally breaksWhen bone is broken in this manner (i.e., with plastic deformation) it cannot easily be reapproximated, and when glued back together, shape is not normalDifferent forms of force can act upon bone: Compression, tension, shearing, and bending and rotation, which are combination of first 3In general, bone fails 1st at tension and 2nd at compression (i.e., if rib is bent by placing 2 thumbs against surface and pushing, compression occurs at point of contact with thumbs and tension on opposite side)General classification of fracturesWhile there are numerous names for fractures (over 100 terms used), potentially all fractures of long bones can be described using some basic terms: Extent, integrity of overlying skin, direction of fracture, location of fracture, and alignment of fracture endsExtent: Complete or incompleteIntegrity of overlying skin: Open vs. closed, depending upon intactness of overlying skin, with closed fracture having intact skin and open fracture having lacerated skin (\"simple\" is older term for closed, and \"compound\" is older term for open; these older terms are not preferred)Direction of fracture: Transverse, oblique, spiralLocation of fracture: Epiphyseal, metaphyseal, diaphysealAlignment of fracture ends: Displaced or nondisplacedSpecific types of fracturesIn general, fractures of long bones can be divided into incomplete and completeIncomplete fractures are those which do not involve full-thickness of boneGreenstick fracture: Often involve shaft of bone and are associated with children due to failure of bone at point of tension with maintenance of integrity at point of compressionTorus fracture: Rounded expanse of bone produced by longitudinal compressionDepressed fracture: Involve cranium with failure of outer table of bone but with maintenance of integrity of inner table of boneComplete fractures are those which do involve full-thickness of boneTransverse fracture: Fracture line extends 90° perpendicular to cortical surfaceOblique fracture: Fracture line extends tangential to cortical surfaceSpiral fracture: Fracture line corkscrews along axis of bone; although spiral fractures have been associated with abuse in children, caution must be used, as accidents can also produce spiral fracturesComminuted fracture: Fracture characterized by multiple fragments of boneSegmental fracture: 2 fracture lines occur on same bone at separate locations, resulting in segment of bone being removed from shaftSome fracture terminology for cranium is different than that for long bonesLinear fracture: Single fracture lineDiastatic fracture: Separation of cranial bones along sutures; these most commonly occur in children but can also occur in adultsDepressed skull fracture and comminuted skull fracture are same as aboveSpecific fractures associated with specific scenariosNumber of eponyms and clinical scenarios used to name fractures is significant; only some mentioned hereColles fracture: Fracture of distal radius due to fall on out-stretched upper extremityRing fracture: Fracture encircling foramen magnum due to fall from height and landing on feet or impact to top of headParry fracture: Fracture of radius or ulna, associated with self-defense against attacker and raising forearm to ward off blowBoxer's fracture: Fracture of 4th or 5th metacarpal, associated with striking another person with fistMetaphyseal fracture (also called chip or bucket handle fracture): Associated with child abuseIdentification of Natural DiseaseCommon natural diseases encountered by forensic anthropologists include osteoporosis, Paget disease, osteoarthritis, and osteomyelitisOsteoporosisMorphology: Cut section of bone would reveal loss of bony trabeculae, resulting in decreased density of boneAssociations: Senility, postmenopausal, endocrine disorders (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, Cushing disease)Complications: Fractures, compression fractures of vertebrae, which can in turn lead to kyphoscoliosis or lumbar lordosisPaget diseaseMorphology: Thickened bone, which upon microscopic examination has mosaic patternComplications: Risk for fracture and can also create impingement at nerve and vessel foramina in craniumOsteoarthritisMorphology: Eburnation of articular surfaces can occur, which appear as smooth, shiny surface of bone, but much more commonly found are osteophytic spurs and new bone growth, often at edges of articular surfaceComplications: If osteophytic spurs connect, fusion can occur, which can result in immobilization at jointIdentification of Morphologic VariantsGeneral considerationsDescription: Morphologic variants are variants in normal anatomy, which can be identified upon examination of skeletal remainsMorphologic variants have been associated with certain ancestral groupsMorphologic variants should not be confused with trauma or natural diseaseCommon morphologic variantsMetopic suture: Suture line extending between bregma, which is intersection of coronal and sagittal sutures and nasion; this suture is between left and right frontal bone and normally closes by 8 years of age; however, it can persist in some individualsSutural bones: Accessory ossicles that appear as island in suture; they can be found at numerous locations but commonly are lambda (intersection of lambdoid sutures and sagittal suture) or bregma or along course of sagittal sutureInca bone: Large bone at apex of occipital bone at lambda, which is due to failure of fusion of ossification centers in occipital bone and is associated with mendosal sutures on endocranial surface, which can be confused with inflicted injury in childMandibular torus: Bony ridge on lingual surface of mandibleSeptal aperture: Perforation of olecranon fossa to coronoid fossa of humerus, which can resemble gunshot woundIdentification of Postmortem ChangeGeneral considerationsPostmortem change can resemble trauma or natural diseasePostmortem change can fall into one of several categories: Weathering, discoloration, cut marks, rodent gnawing or carnivore scavenging, and cultural modificationWeathering produces cracking and splitting of outer surface of boneDiscoloration of bone can occur secondary to deposition in soil, thermal effects, and contact with metal objects; contact with oxidized copper, such as jacket of projectile, can produce light green discoloration of boneCut marks: If partially skeletonized remains need to be dismembered for final removal of soft tissue, careless use of scalpels and other sharp objects can mark skeletal remainsRodent gnawing: Rodents gnaw cortical bone to obtain minerals, including calcium; characteristic appearance are numerous parallel small grooves in bone at surfaceCarnivore scavenging: Carnivores will often chew on proximal and distal ends of long bones to retrieve bone marrow; gnawing can produce round puncture sites in surface of boneAncillary TestingObtaining Material for DNACortical bone and teeth can serve as source for DNACommon bones used are femur (shaft), tibia (shaft), or bones of footWhen taking fragment of shaft for DNA, it is best to not cut entirely through diameter of shaft and instead just cut down to marrow cavity and block out 2 cm or larger segment; this preserves integrity of shaft of bone (i.e., does not divide bone into 2 fragments)ReportingGeneral ConsiderationsReport of skeletal remains should include list of bones present, including their sidedness, estimation of sex, age at time of death, ancestry, and stature as well as identification of trauma (antemortem, perimortem, or postmortem), morphologic variants, natural disease, and postmortem changesAbility to include biological profile will depend upon skeletal remains present; e.g., with complete skeleton, estimation of sex, age at death, ancestry, and stature should be possible; however, if sternum is only bone present, ability to develop complete biological profile will be impaired",

when force is applied more slowly, such as blunt force trauma in beating with baseball bat, ↑ in strain is much greater than ↑ in stress and bone response is more like rubber in that bone bends; however, this bending reaches point where it does not reverse (i.e., plastic deformation) and then where it finally breaksWhen bone is broken in this manner (i.e., with plastic deformation) it cannot easily be reapproximated, and when glued back together, shape is not normalDifferent forms of force can act upon bone: Compression, tension, shearing, and bending and rotation, which are combination of first 3In general, bone fails 1st at tension and 2nd at compression (i.e., if rib is bent by placing 2 thumbs against surface and pushing, compression occurs at point of contact with thumbs and tension on opposite side)General classification of fracturesWhile there are numerous names for fractures (over 100 terms used), potentially all fractures of long bones can be described using some basic terms: Extent, integrity of overlying skin, direction of fracture, location of fracture, and alignment of fracture endsExtent: Complete or incompleteIntegrity of overlying skin: Open vs. closed, depending upon intactness of overlying skin, with closed fracture having intact skin and open fracture having lacerated skin (\"simple\" is older term for closed, and \"compound\" is older term for open; these older terms are not preferred)Direction of fracture: Transverse, oblique, spiralLocation of fracture: Epiphyseal, metaphyseal, diaphysealAlignment of fracture ends: Displaced or nondisplacedSpecific types of fracturesIn general, fractures of long bones can be divided into incomplete and completeIncomplete fractures are those which do not involve full-thickness of boneGreenstick fracture: Often involve shaft of bone and are associated with children due to failure of bone at point of tension with maintenance of integrity at point of compressionTorus fracture: Rounded expanse of bone produced by longitudinal compressionDepressed fracture: Involve cranium with failure of outer table of bone but with maintenance of integrity of inner table of boneComplete fractures are those which do involve full-thickness of boneTransverse fracture: Fracture line extends 90° perpendicular to cortical surfaceOblique fracture: Fracture line extends tangential to cortical surfaceSpiral fracture: Fracture line corkscrews along axis of bone; although spiral fractures have been associated with abuse in children, caution must be used, as accidents can also produce spiral fracturesComminuted fracture: Fracture characterized by multiple fragments of boneSegmental fracture: 2 fracture lines occur on same bone at separate locations, resulting in segment of bone being removed from shaftSome fracture terminology for cranium is different than that for long bonesLinear fracture: Single fracture lineDiastatic fracture: Separation of cranial bones along sutures; these most commonly occur in children but can also occur in adultsDepressed skull fracture and comminuted skull fracture are same as aboveSpecific fractures associated with specific scenariosNumber of eponyms and clinical scenarios used to name fractures is significant; only some mentioned hereColles fracture: Fracture of distal radius due to fall on out-stretched upper extremityRing fracture: Fracture encircling foramen magnum due to fall from height and landing on feet or impact to top of headParry fracture: Fracture of radius or ulna, associated with self-defense against attacker and raising forearm to ward off blowBoxer's fracture: Fracture of 4th or 5th metacarpal, associated with striking another person with fistMetaphyseal fracture (also called chip or bucket handle fracture): Associated with child abuseIdentification of Natural DiseaseCommon natural diseases encountered by forensic anthropologists include osteoporosis, Paget disease, osteoarthritis, and osteomyelitisOsteoporosisMorphology: Cut section of bone would reveal loss of bony trabeculae, resulting in decreased density of boneAssociations: Senility, postmenopausal, endocrine disorders (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, Cushing disease)Complications: Fractures, compression fractures of vertebrae, which can in turn lead to kyphoscoliosis or lumbar lordosisPaget diseaseMorphology: Thickened bone, which upon microscopic examination has mosaic patternComplications: Risk for fracture and can also create impingement at nerve and vessel foramina in craniumOsteoarthritisMorphology: Eburnation of articular surfaces can occur, which appear as smooth, shiny surface of bone, but much more commonly found are osteophytic spurs and new bone growth, often at edges of articular surfaceComplications: If osteophytic spurs connect, fusion can occur, which can result in immobilization at jointIdentification of Morphologic VariantsGeneral considerationsDescription: Morphologic variants are variants in normal anatomy, which can be identified upon examination of skeletal remainsMorphologic variants have been associated with certain ancestral groupsMorphologic variants should not be confused with trauma or natural diseaseCommon morphologic variantsMetopic suture: Suture line extending between bregma, which is intersection of coronal and sagittal sutures and nasion; this suture is between left and right frontal bone and normally closes by 8 years of age; however, it can persist in some individualsSutural bones: Accessory ossicles that appear as island in suture; they can be found at numerous locations but commonly are lambda (intersection of lambdoid sutures and sagittal suture) or bregma or along course of sagittal sutureInca bone: Large bone at apex of occipital bone at lambda, which is due to failure of fusion of ossification centers in occipital bone and is associated with mendosal sutures on endocranial surface, which can be confused with inflicted injury in childMandibular torus: Bony ridge on lingual surface of mandibleSeptal aperture: Perforation of olecranon fossa to coronoid fossa of humerus, which can resemble gunshot woundIdentification of Postmortem ChangeGeneral considerationsPostmortem change can resemble trauma or natural diseasePostmortem change can fall into one of several categories: Weathering, discoloration, cut marks, rodent gnawing or carnivore scavenging, and cultural modificationWeathering produces cracking and splitting of outer surface of boneDiscoloration of bone can occur secondary to deposition in soil, thermal effects, and contact with metal objects; contact with oxidized copper, such as jacket of projectile, can produce light green discoloration of boneCut marks: If partially skeletonized remains need to be dismembered for final removal of soft tissue, careless use of scalpels and other sharp objects can mark skeletal remainsRodent gnawing: Rodents gnaw cortical bone to obtain minerals, including calcium; characteristic appearance are numerous parallel small grooves in bone at surfaceCarnivore scavenging: Carnivores will often chew on proximal and distal ends of long bones to retrieve bone marrow; gnawing can produce round puncture sites in surface of boneAncillary TestingObtaining Material for DNACortical bone and teeth can serve as source for DNACommon bones used are femur (shaft), tibia (shaft), or bones of footWhen taking fragment of shaft for DNA, it is best to not cut entirely through diameter of shaft and instead just cut down to marrow cavity and block out 2 cm or larger segment; this preserves integrity of shaft of bone (i.e., does not divide bone into 2 fragments)ReportingGeneral ConsiderationsReport of skeletal remains should include list of bones present, including their sidedness, estimation of sex, age at time of death, ancestry, and stature as well as identification of trauma (antemortem, perimortem, or postmortem), morphologic variants, natural disease, and postmortem changesAbility to include biological profile will depend upon skeletal remains present; e.g., with complete skeleton, estimation of sex, age at death, ancestry, and stature should be possible; however, if sternum is only bone present, ability to develop complete biological profile will be impaired"

          "KEY FACTS": "Postmortem CulturesValuable in selected patients; not in all patientsInterpretation of true positive is challengingCareful preparation and technique is importantBlood cultures are classic standardSwabs for abscess, isolated areasMore sampling post mortem (organs, swabs, blood, urine, etc.) not beneficialAgonal spread and postmortem transmigration effects usually lowInterpretation of Classic CulturesMay not correlate to premortem if antibiotics administeredAlways correlate results with histologic findingsMost (not all) polymicrobial cultures false-positiveMany (not all) isolated cultures true positiveAlternatives to CulturesHistology: Signs of inflammation/reaction necessary for positive correlation to cultureHistology only can identify many bacteria, fungiSpecial stains may narrow down choicesSome microorganisms best identified with histologyImmunostaining helpful to identify many species but usually limited to research or Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Molecular methods increasingly used pre- and post mortemGross Signs of Sepsis, InfectionReasons for culture: Abscesses, purpura, lung consolidationThanatomicrobiomeStudy of microbes populating orifices and organs after deathChanges in microbiome may be predictable and potentially used in time of death determinationOVERVIEWHistoricalOnce regarded as necessary component of autopsyQuestion sensitivity, validity, and use, particularly with rising costsGeneral Classes of CasesUseful in many cases; strongest consideration for use includesSudden death in infants, children outside hospitalDeath outside hospital with clinical history (fever, malaise, cough, etc.)Deaths with anatomic findings of sepsis (purpura, abscess, endocarditis, meningitis, etc.)EquivocalDrowning (may grow fresh or seawater microbes)Deaths with anatomic findings or clinical history suggesting infection but death over 48 hoursLikely not helpfulPremortem antibiotic therapy well initiatedAdult deaths without history or signs of infectious diseaseRoutine use in all hospital autopsiesUnconfirmed But Classic AssumptionsPostmortem cultures should widely sample blood, lungs, urine, spleen, CSF, cavity swabsAdults: False; studies in adults do not document advantage with multiple sitesBlood is preferred sample; swabs of abscessMultiple samples may be of benefit in infantsPostmortem translocation and agonal transmission of microbes is common and alter culture resultsFalse; cultures should be taken prior to dissection, handling of bowel, etc.\nAgonal transmission (from CPR) and translocation (breakdown of normal tissue barriers) post mortem is uncommon, even after 24 hours if body is refrigeratedPure culture is indicative of true positiveFalse: Confirm with histology, biochemical markersPositive cultures do not prove infectious diseaseCultures must be obtained within few hours of deathFalse: Cultures can be obtained for at least 48 hours if body is refrigeratedGenerally valid up to start of decomposition changesPostmortem cultures are unreliable and ineffectiveFalse: In some studies, they caused or contributed to death in high percentage of individualsMost valuable in sudden infant deaths and older children, adults with premortem symptomsPostmortem cultures have much higher contamination rate than cultures in living individualsFalse: Properly prepared cultures have equal or lower contamination ratePostmortem preparation is more extensive than normal culturesSearing of tissue normal procedureSimple wipes with iodine or alcohol not sufficientAntibiotic sensitivity should never be run on postmortem culturesRequest with rapidly lethal infections, such as meningitisOutbreaks of new antibiotic resistance well knownMany postmortem cultures do not need sensitivitiesCLASSIC USE IN AUTOPSYGeneral ConsiderationsUseful in select casesRequires culture material, sampling, and sterilization toolsRequires proximity, rapid transport to microbiology laboratoryMost will not survive mail-in submissionsHighest yield in symptomatic, nonhospitalized patientsImportant consideration in infants, even if not symptomaticTypes of CulturesLaboratory may have unique collection bottles for instrumentationObtain supplies from laboratory doing testingBlood cultures: Aerobic, anaerobic, and fungal possiblePediatric tubes with lower blood requirement usually availableCulture bottle has range of blood needed (5-20 ml)Draw aerobic first to avoid air introduction in anaerobic containerFollow directions for needed sample size; most run on automatic equipmentSwabs: Nasal, abscess, skin, cavitiesSome use for lung, spleen culturesViral culture swabs different than those for bacteriaSome swabs have collection devices for anaerobic and aerobic bacteriaFluid collection: CSF, urine, joint fluid, effusions (pericardial, peritoneal, pleural)Usually collected pure in sterile tube and submittedTissue: Sections, ~1 cm² for culture from various organsSubmitted as tissue in sterile containerSites for CulturesBlood: Most common and standardizedPreferred matrix for assessing sepsis, infectionObtain from heart, sear atrium and draw blood in sterile needleShould be done prior to femoral draw for toxicology, any dissection or manipulation of gastrointestinal (GI) tractTissueSear tissue, then with sterile knife, cut ~ 1-cm cube below seared edgePlace in sterile containerLungs (pneumonia);

(Sauvageau, 2010) or any external blockage (Dolinak, 2005)Snow immersion: Falling, crashing into snow, unable to extradite or breath airStrangulation: Impairment of blood supply by mechanical constriction of vesselsSuffocation: Broad term reflecting inability of O₂ to reach lungs for exchangeTraumatic asphyxia: Restriction of chest movement is due to heavy object pressing against chestVitiated atmosphere: Spoiled or impaired atmosphere producing chemical interference with O₂OVERVIEWAsphyxia SynopsisGeneral term for impaired or absent exchange of O₂ and CO₂Broad

light, usually washed off easilyBullet fragments, lubricants: Debris, metal wipe from bulletsWeapon characteristics: Patterns on fired bullets reflecting rifling patterns on specific firearmOverviewFirearms are large class of weapons capable of producing rapidly moving projectiles by production of high-pressure gas from propellantRudimentary knowledge of firearms and strong understanding of wound characteristics and patterns needed for gunshot wound interpretationBallistic damage varies with firearm, ammunition, range, and type of target tissueBallistic injury to bodyProjectiles produce permanent and temporary cavities; each will vary with ammunition, weapon, and tissueUnique fracture patterns in bone assist with direction of fire and sometimes sequence of fireRecognition of firearm residue and markings critical for identifying range of fireTERMINOLOGYClasses of firearmsLong gun: Shoulder arm with long barrel; requires 2 hands for operationRifle: Shoulder arm with spiral grooving \"rifling\" on inner surface of breech to direct projectileFires projectiles of bullets or shellsCompact area of impactHigher accuracy from riflingShotgun: Shoulder arm with smooth boreFires shells with 1 or more balls, pellets of shotWider area of impact; pellets rapidly diverge to sprayLower accuracy from lack of riflingDesigned to spray large area with small shot, killing birds/small animals difficult with single shotHistoric: Rarely seen; firearms dating to 16th centuryMusket: Muzzle loading long gun, smooth boreCarbine: Musket or rifle with short barrel, < 22 cmHandgun: Firearm designed for operation with 1 hand; short barrel (< 10 in)Pistol: Cartridge is loaded directly in chamber, usually from magazine or clipMagazine or clip has capacity for multiple cartridges; loads in place near rear portion of barrelRevolver: Cartridge loaded in cylinder that rotates on firingUsually 6-cartridge capacity but may be single to 24Rotational loadingMay be single or double actionSingle action: Hammer manually pulled back to rotate cylinderDouble action: Cylinder rotates with trigger pullHistoric: Derringer: Multiple barreled small firearmCharacteristics of FirearmsWeapon featuresCaliber: Inside diameter of bore, part of firearm nameWorld, except USA: Metric based (mm), i.e., 9 mm, 7 mmUSA: Inches (0.22, 0.357) often stated as number 22, 357Not used for shotgunsRifling: Spiral twist within bore of handgun or rifle to spin bullet, improve aerodynamics and accuracyLands: Strips left in bore after rifling; grips and twists passing bullet, producing spinGrooves: Area removed during rifling process; have fine impressions unique to firearmPatterns on fired bullets from rifled firearms reflect weapon type, number, and twist of lands and individual marks in grooves linked to specific firearmNewer rifling techniques without lands and grooves are difficult to identify ballistic informationMicrogroove (12-22 shallow groove)Polygonal boring (rounded, rectangular profile)Firing mechanism: Action needed to fire projectileSingle shot: Loads only 1 cartridgeBreak and bolt: Breech must be opened, shell extracted, and new shell inserted for each shotRepeating: Includes bolt action with magazine, lever and pump actionsHand action required to eject fired case and rechamber new cartridgeSemiautomatic: Ejection and rechambering automatically done by firing mechanismRequires separate trigger pull for each shotAutomatic: Recoil used to eject casing and chamber new roundWill fire continuously with trigger pullLegal use only with military and policeShotgun terminologyChoke: Constriction at end of bore to minimize shot dispersionMeasure of shot in 30-incircle at 40 yardsFull choke: 65-75% of shot; modified 55-65%; cylinder bore (no choke): 35-45%Gauge: Type of measurement for shotgunNumber of balls with diameter of shotgun barrel that can be made from 1 lb of leadLower number is larger boreReflects time when most ammunition was homemadeLoading positionMuzzle: Historical, extremely uncommon; loaded single shot from forward end of gunBreech: Loaded in rear portion of gun barrel near firing positionBreech block or recoil plate: Reinforced area designed to withstand rearward thrust exerted by cartridge at time of firing explosionCartridge: Holds bullet and firing components; cartridge is terminology used with rifles and handguns, not shotgunsPrimer (cap): Chemical mixture that explodes with heat or contact of firing pin, igniting propellantLead azide, lead styphnate, barium nitrate commonHistoric: Mercury fulminate, antimony sulfide, potassium chlorate, powdered glassPropellant (powder): Ignited by primer; explodes to create large gas volume to eject shotModern: Smokeless powder: Cellulose nitrate, nitroglycerin; increased gas, higher velocity of projectile, much less residueHistoric: Black powder: Potassium nitrate, sulfur, charcoal; abundant solid residual material; slower velocity of projectileBullet: Commonly lead in low-velocity weapons; may have jacket; different shapes and nose constructionJacket: Metal covering (full jacket) or partially covering (semijacket) bulletsUsed in automatic, semiautomatic pistols, high-velocity firearms, militaryGliding metal prevents melting of lead bulletMay separate from bullet when target is hitCopper, nickel, and aluminium are common jacket materials\"Gliding bullet\": Lead bullet with copper or alloy layerNose: Ballistic characteristics depend on \"nose\" (forward-most portion) of projectileRound: Comes to point, most commonHollow point : Depression in nose, mushrooms on contact, slows bullet, greater injury path and reduced potential for body exitWadcutter: Flat nose, cannelures on body, intermediate injury potentialSpecialty bullets: Different firing characteristics for different rolesIncludes plastic, exploding, frangible, blanks, sabot, and flechette bulletsUncommon in forensic practiceCase: Encloses all parts of cartridgeUsually with identifiers of caliber, load, and manufacturerFunctions to expand and seal chamber against rearward gas escape when firedFiring pin location may be rim, pin-fire, or center-fireShell: Holds pellets and firing components for shotgun; comparable to cartridge for rifles and handgunsPrimer: Chemical mixture that ignites on firing; located at base of shellPropellant: Powder (usually smokeless) providing explosive gas expansion to propel shell from firearmWadding: Material used to separate propellant and shotCardboard, plastic commonSeveral variations with different ammunitionFiller: Small granules, usually white polyethylene, used to fill spaces between larger shotCup: Component of more modern shells, holds pellets and may replace some wadding layersPellets, \"shot\": Usually round and multiple; size designated commercially by letters and numbers; larger numbers are smaller sizedBirdshot: Smaller pellet diameter for small prey; 50-500 pellets per shellBuckshot: Larger diameter pellets for larger prey; 8-40 per shellFoster rifled slug, French Blondeau, pumpkin ball, Brenneke: All names for single, dumbbell-shaped shotSabot slug: Single, hourglass slug with mass forward; great shocking effect; bear, large preyFirearm Residue and MarkingsFlame, flash: Superheated, oxygen-deprived gases \"flash\" at muzzle of gunSear but cannot ignite skin, clothingDistance usually within mm;

atherosclerotic occlusions are frequently identified within proximal aspect of LAD or LCA, or anywhere along RCAFixed occlusions causing < 70% luminal area narrowing are often considered as asymptomaticFixed occlusions causing > 70% luminal area narrowing are often symptomatic with increased cardiac demandFixed occlusions causing > 90% luminal area narrowing may be symptomatic at restGenerally accepted that for single-vessel involvement, lesions with 75% luminal area narrowing can cause sudden cardiac deathMyocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death are frequently result of acute plaque change (i.e., intraluminal thrombus formation upon site of plaque rupture)In cases of acute thrombosis causing sudden cardiac death, majority of underlying atherosclerotic lesions were asymptomatic prior to plaque rupture and thrombus formationAdrenergic stimulation can predispose vulnerable plaques to rupture (intense emotional stress is associated with development of acute

InfarctionMost frequently due to atherosclerotic CAD (i.e., acute thrombosis of ruptured atherosclerotic plaque)Small percentage of cases due to coronary artery vasospasm or embolic event (e.g., from valve vegetation)Infarcts limited to subendocardial myocardium (i.e., nontransmural) can result from severe coronary artery atherosclerosis (without thrombosis) due to marginal perfusion in setting of

aneurysms Thoracic aneurysms also associated with connective tissue disorders (e.g., Marfan syndrome), bicuspid aortic valves, and tertiary syphilis Aortic DissectionDefined by presence of blood within arterial media (introduced through intimal tear)Instigating intimal tear typically located within ascending aortaDissection through media can occur retrograde (toward heart) or distally (toward abdominal aorta)Historically associated with aortic aneurysm (referred to as dissecting aneurysm); however, aortic dissection can occur in absence of aortic aneurysmMajority of patients are

femoral bloodCollect in tube containing sodium or potassium fluoride preservativesGray top tubesFluoride ions act as enzymatic inhibitors to prevent further ethanol production after collectionAs feasible, additional samples (e.g., urine and vitreous) should also be collected and retainedAvoid collecting blood via blind needle sticks into chestVitreous can serve as viable sample sourceAt equilibrium, vitreous:blood ratio is 1.2Equilibrium of vitreous alcohol trails blood alcohol by 1-2 hoursIf vitreous alcohol concentration is < BAC, decedent died during absorptive phaseSkeletal muscle can also be analyzedTesting on embalmed bodies can be accomplished with vitreous or muscle samplesReportingToxicology InterpretationWhile qualitative measurements of ethanol in postmortem samples is simple to obtain, interpretation of those results requires consideration ofCondition of bodyInterval between death and autopsyEnvironmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity)Nature of analyzed specimenEthanol can be produced within body after deathBacterial fermentation of glucose during decompositionTypical levels produced during decomposition are < 0.07g/dL; in rare cases, has been reported to reach 0.1-0.2 g/dLPostmortem diffusion of alcohol from stomach to central blood has been reported in association with bouts of heavy drinkingPlasma/serum to whole blood ratios are reported as 1.10-1.35 (average 1.18)Concentrations measured in whole blood are < that in plasma/serum, as whole blood contains less water than does plasma/serum, and alcohol distributes uniformly according to body waterDuring absorptive phase, arterial blood may have 40% higher alcohol concentration than venous blood (this difference is not present during postabsorptive phase)Urine alcohol concentrations not useful for estimating BACAlcohol concentrations must be interpreted in context of additional drugs/medications with synergistic effects (e.g., benzodiazepines, opiates, etc.)Death

dependent users, abrupt cessation of alcohol intake leads to brain hyperexcitability Mild withdrawal symptoms may begin even when user has measurable amount of alcohol in system or up to 12 hours after drinking cessationAnxietyIrritability AgitationTremorsInsomniaNausea/vomitingSweatingTachycardia Hallucinations (auditory, visual, or tactile) may begin 12-24 hours after last drink and usually

drinkHallucinationsDisorientation Confusion and agitationTachycardia and hypertension Constitutes a medical emergencyReported mortality rates up to 5%Investigative ConsiderationsGeneral ConsiderationsPresence of alcohol/alcohol containers is important consideration at any sceneMust also be cognizant of alternative alcohol sources (e.g., empty bottles of mouthwash or cold/cough syrup) Alcohol is frequent contributing factor in motor vehicle crash incidentsAlcohol use history should be obtained from family/friends as appropriate With chronic abusers, absence of alcohol at scene may be only indication of withdrawal With acute intoxication, decedents may roll/fall into compromising positions while unconsciousPositional asphyxia Position of decedents should be documented with thorough photography Presence of dark brown granular blood (\"coffee-ground emesis\") may indicate acute gastrointestinal hemorrhagic eventAcute gastrointestinal hemorrhage can produce large quantities of expelled bloodQuantity of blood on decedent and at scene may mimic traumatic event Autopsy FindingsAcute Intoxication Potential findings are nonspecificPulmonary congestion and edemaGastric mucosal injuryHepatic steatosisDistended bladderAspiration of vomitus Individuals dying from acute intoxication may show disease processes associated with chronic abuse (e.g., cirrhosis, dilated cardiomyopathy, etc.)Acute Withdrawal\nDiagnosis is largely dependent on scene findings, investigation, and toxicology resultsNonspecific autopsy findings might include Dehydration pattern of electrolytes on vitreous chemistryIntramuscular hemorrhage of tongue (from seizure activity)Chronic UseChronic alcohol use is associated with wide variety of disease processes, includingHepatic cirrhosis May be associated with jaundice or scleral icterusEsophageal varices May be associated with acute gastrointestinal hemorrhagePancreatitis (acute or chronic)Dilated cardiomyopathy Cerebellar vermal atrophyAcute Wernicke encephalopathy manifest as mammillary body hemorrhageAncillary TestingToxicologyAntemortem specimens are preferable over postmortem when availableOptimal sample site is femoral bloodCollect in tube containing sodium or potassium fluoride preservativesGray top tubesFluoride ions act as enzymatic inhibitors to prevent further ethanol production after collectionAs feasible, additional samples (e.g., urine and vitreous) should also be collected and retainedAvoid collecting blood via blind needle sticks into chestVitreous can serve as viable sample sourceAt equilibrium, vitreous:blood ratio is 1.2Equilibrium of vitreous alcohol trails blood alcohol by 1-2 hoursIf vitreous alcohol concentration is < BAC, decedent died during absorptive phaseSkeletal muscle can also be analyzedTesting on embalmed bodies can be accomplished with vitreous or muscle samplesReportingToxicology InterpretationWhile qualitative measurements of ethanol in postmortem samples is simple to obtain, interpretation of those results requires consideration ofCondition of bodyInterval between death and autopsyEnvironmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity)Nature of analyzed specimenEthanol can be produced within body after deathBacterial fermentation of glucose during decompositionTypical levels produced during decomposition are < 0.07g/dL; in rare cases, has been reported to reach 0.1-0.2 g/dLPostmortem diffusion of alcohol from stomach to central blood has been reported in association with bouts of heavy drinkingPlasma/serum to whole blood ratios are reported as 1.10-1.35 (average 1.18)Concentrations measured in whole blood are < that in plasma/serum, as whole blood contains less water than does plasma/serum, and alcohol distributes uniformly according to body waterDuring absorptive phase, arterial blood may have 40% higher alcohol concentration than venous blood (this difference is not present during postabsorptive phase)Urine alcohol concentrations not useful for estimating BACAlcohol concentrations must be interpreted in context of additional drugs/medications with synergistic effects (e.g., benzodiazepines, opiates, etc.)Death from acute alcohol intoxication is routinely classified as accidentDeath from chronic alcohol abuse is routinely classified as natural"

naturally occurring chemical found in opium (e.g., morphine, codeine, thebaine)Opioid is synthetic or manufactured drug resembling or mimicking effects of opiatesSemisynthetic opioids are those opioids derived from naturally occurring opiates (e.g., heroin, oxycodone, and hydrocodone)Synthetic opioids are those opioids derived in laboratory, not from opium poppy (e.g., methadone and fentanyl)Narcotic is derived from Greek narkotikon, meaning \"to be numb\"Morphine is derived from Morpheus, Greek god of dreamsOVERVIEWSource of Heroin and MorphineOpiates are derived from Papaver somniforum plant, commonly known as opium poppyRaw opium was only known analgesic in early recorded historyNaturally occurring opiates derived from poppy resin (opium) includeMorphineMost prevalent opium alkaloid (opium contains 10-16% morphine)Poppy seeds may contain morphine at concentrations of 4-200 mg/kgCan be used as drug, or for production of semisynthetic opioidsHeroin (diacetylmorphine) is synthesized from morphineCodeine, while naturally occurring in opium, is also commonly synthesized from morphineCodeineMinor component of opium (opium contains 0.5% codeine)Used as analgesic, cough suppressantThebaineUsed for synthesis of semisynthetic opioids (e.g., oxycodone and hydrocodone)Regions of prominent opium production include Mexico, Southeast Asia, Southwest Asia, and South AmericaRoutes of AdministrationMorphine is availableIn liquid preparations (for either oral ingestion or injection)As tablet or capsuleAs suppositoryHeroin is availableAs powder (white or black)As black tar-like substanceHeroin may be injected, smoked, or snortedCLINICAL ISSUESMetabolism of MorphineMorphine has t1/2 of 2-3 hoursMajority of administered morphine is converted in liver to inactive metabolite, morphine-3-glucoronideMorphine-6-glucuronide is active metaboliteMetabolism of Heroint1/2Heroin: 2-6 minutes6-MAM: 6-40 minutesMorphine: 2-3 hoursHeroin is rapidly deacetylated in blood (by blood esterases) to 6-MAM6-MAM is further hydrolyzed to morphine (presumably in liver)Physiologic EffectsOpiates and opioids act upon opioid receptors in brainNotably μ receptorEndogenous activators of opioid receptors include endorphinsMorphine and heroin act asCNS depressantsAnalgesicsIn brain tissue, heroin has very little affinity for opioid receptorsNarcotic activity of heroin is attributed to 6-MAM and morphineModerate doses of morphine or heroin produceEuphoriaConstricted (pinpoint) pupilsNauseaConstipationHigher doses may produceDrowsiness, sedation, or comaRespiratory depressionDepressed cough reflexToxicityFatal outcomes are not directly related to morphine blood levelsMorphine concentrations in overdose victims vary widely, depending on decedent's prior narcotic use historyAddicts who die from unrelated traumatic causes (e.g., gunshot wounds) may have morphine blood concentrations exceeding those of naive users who die from overdoseGiven heroin's rapid t1/2, detection of parent heroin in blood rarely occursDetection of 6-MAM is more frequently encountered6-MAM is specific for heroin useWith heroin use, small levels of codeine may also be

        "raw_text": "Historical OriginsAncient EgyptEgypt was among first civilizations to apply forensic practicesMedicine and law were united in work of priests that served as both physicians and juristsImhotep (ca. 2667-2648 BC), founder of ancient Egyptian medicine, has been described as first medicolegal expertPliny (Roman author) recorded that bodies of those who died were examined to ascertain cause of deathDeterminations regarding cause and manner of death were likely made by priestsFairly extensive knowledge of toxicology was requiredMedical practice and treatment was heavily influenced by religion, superstition, and magicAncient Egyptian texts demonstrate detailed knowledge of anatomy, but scholars debate whether this came from animal or human studyRemoval of internal organs was performed but as component of embalming processEmbalmers were of low social classRemoval of organs provided embalmers opportunity to observe natural and diseased organ statesHowever, embalmers likely did not communicate with priests or other upper class individuals practicing medicineKing Ptolemy I Soter (ca. 367-282 BC) established university and library in AlexandriaPtolemy authorized medical officials to dissect and examine bodiesMost early dissections were performed on criminalsMembers of royal family occasionally attendedAncient GreeceAnatomy played only small part in early Greek medical theoryAncient Greek system of medicine was based on balance of 4 humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile)Function of internal organs was thought to be limited to production and circulation of these humorsScholars have debated whether early Greeks performed human dissections; it is likely no human dissections were performed in Greek world prior to 3rd century BCBy 3rd century BC, human dissection was allowed with official approval in Alexandria for study of normal anatomy and diseasePhysicians Herophilus (ca. 335-280 BC) and Erasistratus (ca. 310-250 BC) performed systematic dissections on prisoners provided from royal jailHerophilusPerformed 1st known autopsies for characterizing course of diseaseWrote treatise on human anatomyRegarded as the \"father of anatomy\"ErasistratusLargely abandoned prevalent humoral theory in favor of solidist theory, realizing that diseases were associated with changes in solid organsContributions of Herophilus and Erasistratus to anatomy and disease were significant but short livedBoth Herophilus and Erasistratus have been accused of vivisection, dissecting prisoners \"while they were yet breathing\"Galen (ca. AD 130-210)Best known for his systemization and innovation of Hippocratic medical traditionStudied anatomy principally through dissection and vivisection of animals (pigs and apes)Credited as 1st to correlate patient complaints and symptoms with what was found upon examination of affected area of deceasedHis written masterpiece, On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body, was based on humoral theory (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) and dominated medical thought for centuriesRomansAutopsy of Julius Caesar (March 44 BC) is recognized as earliest recorded autopsy report in historyPhysician Antistius offered opinion that of 23 stab wounds, none were fatal except for wound to breastAntistius' report gave rise to Latin term forensics, meaning \"before the forum\" (where Antistius delivered his opinion)Justinian enactments (529-564)Provided for regulation of practice of medicineRequired proof of competence by means of examinationImposed penalties for malpracticeCharacterized function of medical expert as assisting judiciary by impartial interpretation and opinion based on specialized knowledgeRegarded as highest point of achievement in forensic medicine in ancient worldMiddle Ages and RenaissanceEast AsiaIn 6th century, Chinese physician Chich-ts'si wrote 1st known treatise on forensic medicineDuring Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392), published texts on forensic medicine were in useIn 1247, Song Ci edited classic Chinese text on death investigation (Xi-Yuan-Lu, or Records for Washing Away of Wrong Cases)Emphasized role of officers investigating deaths, rather than that of medical practitionersRecognized as world's 1st systemic handbook for postmortem examinationsEventually translated into numerous languagesCovered findings in cases of infanticide, drowning, hanging, poisoning, and assaultEuropeReports from 4th and 10th centuries indicate that autopsies were being performed on corpses of criminalsIn late Middle Ages, 1st recorded autopsies were performed chiefly to identify causes of suspicious deathsBy Renaissance, predominant purpose of autopsy was for anatomic dissectionRenaissance is referred to as \"golden age of anatomy\"Andreas Vesalius published De Humani Corporis Fabrica in 1543, the founding text of modern anatomyIn EnglandCoroners were formalized in 1194 by Richard the Lionhearted's Articles of EyreProvided for custos placitorum coronae (keepers of pleas of crown, or coroners)Coroner duties included holding inquests, valuing objects for taxation, obtaining arrest warrants, and ensuring that potential murders were investigatedIn ItalyPope Innocent III provided for appointment of doctors to courts for determination of wounds in 1209In 1231, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II issued decree mandating that 1 human body should be dissected at least once every 5 years for anatomic studies at SalernoIn 1249, Hugo de Lucca took oath as medicolegal expertHuman dissections between 1266 and 1275 were of probable medicolegal natureUniversity of Bologna was largely controlled by law facultyAutopsies were likely solicited to solve legal problems, rather than to promote medical knowledgeClearly recorded case of autopsy for purpose of investigating cause of death dates to 1286In 1302, judge in Bologna ordered autopsy of nobleman who had died under suspicious circumstancesAntipope Alexander V was autopsied in 1410 to investigate possibility of poisoningPhysician Fortunato FedeleMade career of performing autopsies and testifying in courtPublished book on forensic medicine (De Relationes Medicorum) in 1602Paolo ZacchiasPublished 3 volumes on forensic medicine (Quaestiones Medico-Legales) between 1621 and 1651Has been called \"father of forensic medicine\"In GermanyCode of Bamburg (1507) authorized opening of bodies to examine depth and damage caused by woundsCaroline Code (1553) required expert medical testimony to guide judges in cases of murder, wounding, poisoning, hanging, drowning, infanticide, abortion, and other circumstances involving injury to personJohannes Bohn (1640-1718) was pioneer in development of medicolegal autopsiesIn FranceAmbroise Pare (1510-1590)Considered the 1st forensic pathologistWrote on traumatic injuries of organsModern HistoryEast AsiaDuring Japan's Edo period (1603-1868)Coroner investigations were mandatory for cases involving death and unusual incidentsOfficials who investigated scenes were known as kenshi (\"coroners\")EuropeIn EnglandIn 1788, Samuel Farr wrote Elements of Medical Jurisprudence, which contained descriptions of findings required for judgment by coroners and courts of law in cases, including rape and murderIn 1789, Andrew Duncan began lecturing on legal medicine and public healthChair of Forensic Medicine was established at University of Edinburgh in 1803In ItalyIn 1761, anatomist Giovanni Morgagni published De Sedibus based on observations from hundreds of autopsy dissectionsCredited with establishing concept of clinical-pathologic correlationIn Germany and Austria1st known medicolegal clinic established in Vienna ~ 1830 (and 2nd one in Berlin in 1833)Carl von Rokitansky performed 30,000 autopsies at Second Vienna Medical SchoolBasics of modern autopsy techniques were developed by Friedrich Zenker (1825-1898) and Rudolph Virchow (1821-1902)In France1st professional Chair in Legal Medicine established in 1794In 1803, provision required judges to appoint medical experts who were graduates in medicine and had passed examination in legal medicine1st medicolegal clinic established in 1840AmericaColonists brought English coroner system to America1st recorded coroner's inquest in America occurred in 1635 (Plymouth Colony)As early as 1636, role of coroner transitioned from appointed to elected positionBy late 17th century, coroner's autopsies were on record (including a 1691 autopsy of a New York governor presumed to have been poisoned)Dr. J. S. Stringham began lecturing on legal medicine in New York around 1804In 1813, first Chair of Medical Jurisprudence established in New York CityIn 1860, Maryland law enabled coroner to require presence of physician at inquestsIn 1868, physician was appointed coroner of BaltimoreIn 1877, \"medical examiners\" replaced coroners in Massachusetts; first official use of termIn 1890, physicians performing autopsies for coroners in Baltimore are referred to as \"medical examiners\"New York City established 1st true medical examiner system in 1918, replacing their coroner's officeIn 1939, Maryland establishes 1st state medical examiner officeIn 1959, American Board of Pathology began to offer board certification in forensic pathologyNational Association of Medical Examiners (NAME) established in 1966",

        "raw_text": "TERMINOLOGYSynonymsBell mania, acute exhaustive mania, agitated mania, and fatal catatoniaDefinitionsDelirium is syndrome of cognitive disturbances characterized by alterations in consciousness, orientation, memory, thought, and behaviorExcited delirium is delirium characterized by agitation, aggressive or violent behaviorExcited delirium syndrome is sudden death of person following period of excited delirium for which autopsy does not disclose evidence of sufficient trauma or natural disease to otherwise explain deathOVERVIEWGeneral ConsiderationsDelirium is state of acute disturbance in cognition and consciousnessGeneral features includeDisorientation to space and timeDisorganized thought processesDisorganized speechHallucinationsExcited delirium is delirium involving violent behaviorExcited delirium was first described as Bell mania by Dr. Luther Bell in 1849Potentially fatal form of delirium in mentally ill patientsPatients presented with fever, agitation, and inability to sleepViolent behaviors often necessitated physical restraintSymptoms persisted over chronic course (days to months), with death usually occurring after several weeks Reports of fatal cases of Bell mania dissipated in 1950s with introduction of phenothiazinesAcute form of excited delirium was described in 1980s in association with illicit stimulants (e.g., cocaine and methamphetamine)Follows characteristic sequence of eventsDelirium with agitation (e.g., fear, panic, and violent, bizarre, or hyperactive behaviors)Struggle with physical restraintSudden cessation of struggleCardiorespiratory arrest and deathDiffers from Bell mania in thatCases strongly associated with stimulant drug use Death occurs within minutes to hours of symptom onsetCLINICAL ISSUESCase Presentation In its present form, excited delirium syndrome is strongly associated with abuse of illegal stimulantsMost commonly cocaine or methamphetamineRarely phencyclidine (PCP)Most patients are male, and majority do not have underlying mental illnessCases involving patients with underlying mental illness do occur but are less frequent On initial assessment, it is difficult (if not impossible) to distinguish cases of excited delirium due to stimulant abuse from excited delirium due to mental illnessMajority of cases are associated with displays of unexpected strength &/or hyperthermiaDeath invariably occurs within minutes to hours after struggle with police or medical personnel involving use of physical restraints Excited delirium syndrome is acute condition, in contrast to chronic nature of Bell maniaDeath is characterized by cardiopulmonary arrest resistant to cardiopulmonary resuscitative efforts Mechanism of Disease and DeathExcited delirium syndrome is associated with activation of sympathetic nervous system, notably with elevated levels of dopaminePsychostimulants (e.g., cocaine and methamphetamine) increase synaptic levels of dopamine Chronic cocaine use normally leads to compensatory upregulation in dopamine transporters (which aids to clear excessive dopamine from synapses) It is theorized with excited delirium syndrome, there is failure of upregulation of dopamine transporters, and resultant excessive dopamine signaling (i.e., functional hyperdopaminergia) triggers delirium and precipitates autonomic dysfunctionHyperadrenergic state may then cause cardiac dysrhythmia, accounting for fatal outcomesHypothalamic dopamine receptors control thermoregulation, and thus dopamine dysregulation may further account for profound hyperthermia characteristic of excited delirium Means and nature of physical restraint may alternatively suggest death due to positional or traumatic asphyxia Assertion of positional or traumatic asphyxia must be weighed against known case circumstances and published scientific data regarding practicality of restraint-induced hypoxia INVESTIGATIVE CONSIDERATIONSScene InvestigationsComplete and thorough scene investigation is of paramount importance, to include detailed photographic documentationDiagnosis of excited delirium syndrome is largely dependent on investigative circumstances Police reports, emergency medical service reports, and witness statements should all be collected and reviewed In unwitnessed cases, attempts at self-cooling (placement of cold towels, immersion in water) may signify hyperthermiaHyperthermia is important hallmark of excited delirium syndrome and is regarded as harbinger of death Medical Records Past medical records should be collectedMedication list should be reviewed, with attention to drugs with known cardiotoxic effects (e.g., QT prolongation)Clinical features of excited delirium syndrome includeAcute mental status changeAgitationAdrenergic dysfunctionTachycardiaTachypneaHyperthermia DiaphoresisNoncompliance (with police or medical personnel) Increased pain tolerance and unusual strengthAbundant energy and lack of fatigue If there is cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation and ensuing prolonged survival, patients may also develop RhabdomyolysisAcute renal failureDisseminated intravascular coagulation AUTOPSY FINDINGSGeneral ConsiderationsUseful approach to autopsy in cases of suspected excited delirium syndrome is to identify or exclude other intervening injuries or diseases Reported cases of excited delirium syndrome are often associated with significant natural disease (e.g., atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease) that is felt to be contributory to death by making individuals more susceptible to fatal cardiac dysrhythmiaIn other instances, autopsy findings may be minimal External Examination By definition, discovered injuries (e.g., abrasions, contusions) are minorDocument with photography to include pertinent negative findings Internal Examination Complete autopsy should be performed Perform anterior neck dissectionCut-downs of torso and extremities should be considered ANCILLARY TESTINGToxicologyToxicology testing is fundamental step in evaluation of excited delirium syndromeRequest and analyze hospital admission blood samples, if applicable and available Samples should be collected from multiples sources (e.g., peripheral blood, vitreous, urine, &/or bile)Vast majority of cases of excited delirium syndrome will be positive for illicit stimulants, either cocaine or methamphetamine Other reported drugs include PCP, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), cathinones (bath salts), and prescription psychiatric medicationsHistologyHistologic evaluation of organs is important step in properly excluding presence of natural diseaseSample and evaluate cardiac conduction system (e.g., sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes)OtherConsider retention of brain or brain slices, and neuropathology consultation, depending on individual case circumstancesConsider genetic testing for conduction system abnormalities, depending on individual case circumstances Elevations in levels of brain heat shock proteins [i.e., heat shock protein 70 (hsp70)] have been reportedBiomarker of hyperthermiaREPORTINGDeath CertificationDeterminations of cause and manner of death in cases of suspected excited delirium syndrome may have implications regarding allegations of police misconduct or brutality Due to common negative findings (i.e., lack of identifiable injuries), allegations of \"cover-ups\" are not infrequent Rulings should not be issued until ancillary testing has been completed, and all pertinent records have been collected and reviewedDue consideration must be given to alternative intervening causes (e.g., neck or chest compression, blunt force injuries, or significant natural disease) Cause of death statements may be descriptive (e.g., \"cardiac dysrhythmia complicating struggle with physical restraint in a person under the influence of methamphetamine\") Given contribution of physical struggle, manner of death is best classified as either homicide or
