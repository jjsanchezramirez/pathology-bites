to measure bilirubin in bloodDiazo reaction mainly measures conjugated (direct) bilirubinDiazotized sulfanilic acid reacts quickly with conjugated bilirubin, producing azobilirubinAzobilirubin absorbs light at 540 nm and can be measured spectrophotometricallyUnconjugated (indirect) bilirubin can react with diazotized sulfanilic acid, but does so slowlyTo speed up reaction an accelerant is added (often caffeine)Causes unconjugated bilirubin to dissociate from albuminUnconjugated bilirubin can then be measured, allowing for total bilirubin determinationBy subtracting conjugated bilirubin from total bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin fraction is indirectly measuredHPLCUnlike diazo method, HPLC can measure main bilirubin fractions directlyUnconjugatedConjugatedDelta bilirubinFraction of conjugated bilirubin permanently bound to albuminIn states of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, delta bilirubin fraction increasedUseful because delta bilirubin is water soluble and interacts with diazotized sulfanilic acid in diazo methodFalsely elevates measured direct bilirubinBecause delta bilirubin half-life is that of albumin (17-19 days), can persist long after conjugated
