Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (IAIHG) proposed scoring system that includes clinical and pathologic features to reflect certainty of diagnosisWeighted scoring system based on combination of histologic, clinical, and laboratory findings that either provide evidence in support of or against diagnosis of AIHUsed for diagnosis in many major centersHighly sensitive and specific but may have lower sensitivity in some pediatric casesGrade: Severity and extent of necroinflammatory activity, defined as periportal interface activity and lobular inflammation and hepatocyte injuryMany practitioners

structure, or impaired glycogen/glucose utilizationGSD type 0 is no-storage disorder; defect results in inability to produce hepatic glycogen and marked decrease in glycogenType IX group of disorders is distinguished by which subunit of phosphorylase kinase is affected; type IXa accounts for 75% of casesMost forms are autosomal recessive with exception of some subtypes of IX (notably IXa), which are X-linkedCLINICAL ISSUESEpidemiologyIncidenceEstimated incidence of all GSD is 1 in 20,000-40,000 live birthsIncidence of specific types varies widely: Type VI is 1:65,000-85,000; types I, III, IX are 1:100,000; type IV is 1:600,000-800,000; type 0 is extraordinarily rareAgeMost patients diagnosed within 1st decade of life, depending on subtype and its severitySexType IXa is sex-linkedEthnicitySpecific subtypes occur in certain populations: Type I in Ashkenazi Jews; type III in non-Ashkenazi Jews of North African descent; type VI in MennonitesPresentationHepatomegalyType 0 is exception, presenting with small liverFasting hypoglycemiaSevere forms of childhood GSD are associated with seizures induced by hypoglycemia with very short fasting intervals (< 4 hours)Failure to thrive, difficulty in settling down, awakening for feeds, short stature, motor delays, muscle weakness, and obesity are other presenting signs, depending on typeSpecific types may have additional characteristic findingsRecurrent infections and inflammatory bowel disease due to neutropenia and neutrophil dysfunction characterize type IbCardiomyopathy is seen most often in type III, but also IV, VI, XILiver forms and muscle forms characterize the different subtypes of type IXType IV is multisystem disorderUsually presents as progressive liver disease with hepatomegaly, cirrhosis, and liver failureCan present with nonprogressive liver disease, or with severe myopathy with hypotonia and dilated cardiomyopathyLaboratory TestsElevated transaminases, hypoglycemia, and hyperlipidemia commonDuring fasting, lactic acidosis, ketosis, &/or hyperuricemia characterize the various typesElevated serum creatine kinase is seen in some types, including III and IXNeutropenia is seen in type IbHypoalbuminemia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) are seen when there is liver failure, such as in type IVNatural HistoryImprovement of metabolic parameters results in catch-up growth, symptom improvement, and reduced liver sizeLong-term complications depend on the type: Includes renal damage ( type I), inflammatory bowel disease or recurrent infections (type Ib), cardiomyopathy (types III, IV, VI, IX), and cirrhosisCirrhosis develops in 12-15% of patients (types III, IV, IX)Increased incidence of hepatocellular neoplasia in some typesHepatic adenoma

liver, intestine, pancreasFunctions as flippase, flipping aminophospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine from outer to inner lipid layer of cell membrane, enhancing membrane resistance to detergent actions of bile saltsMutations result in loss of membrane bilayer lipid asymmetry, decreased resistance of canalicular membrane to bile salt detergent action, and impaired BSEP activity or farnesoid X

flowD482G variant causes somewhat milder diseasePFIC3: Mutations of ABCB4 gene that encode MDR3 glycoproteinMDR3 is flippase that flips phosphatidylcholine from inner to outer lipid leaflet of canalicular membrane, increasing phospholipids in bile, which reduces its detergent actionsMutations in MDR3 result in decreased concentration of phospholipids in bile, increasing its detergent propertiesDecreased phospholipids destabilize micelles and promote lithogenicity of bile with crystallization of cholesterolPFIC type 4 (PFIC4): Mutations in TJP2 gene that encode for tight junction

unlike PFIC, serum bile acid concentration is lowOther Childhood Cholestatic DisordersHistology of many cholestatic childhood disorders is indistinguishable from PFIC, and their distinction requires serologic, biochemical, and genetic testsAmong conditions that should be considered are syndromic bile duct paucity (Alagille syndrome), Dubin-Johnson syndrome, type 2 citrullinemia, arthrogryposis-renal dysfunction cholestasis (ARC) syndromePrimary Sclerosing CholangitisHistology shows periductal fibrosisCholangiogram shows strictures and dilatationsCystic FibrosisEvidence

fibrosisLow GGT is suggestive of PFICFocal biliary fibrosis with PAS-positive inspissated secretions is typical of cystic fibrosisWilson DiseaseProlonged cholestasis in MDR3 disease may be associated with increased tissue copper and urine copper, mimicking Wilson diseaseWilson disease shows more steatosis and less prominent duct diseaseTPN-Induced CholestasisInfants on TPN may develop cholestasis, and this may be difficult to distinguish from PFICBiopsies may show more steatosis, duct proliferation, and ceroid-laden macrophages in lobulesDIAGNOSTIC CHECKLISTClinically Relevant Pathologic FeaturesBRIC is characterized by cholestasis during attacks but no histologic progressionPFIC is characterized by increasing fibrosis and may show duct paucity, giant cell hepatitis, or bile ductules

this is done prior to sectioning pancreasMain questions to answer during dissectionIs there tumor?Where is tumor?What is site of origin, and what structures are involved?How big is tumor?What is appearance of tumor (solid, cystic, etc.)?If tumor is cystic, document cyst contents: If multi-/unilocular, size of cysts, and presence of mural nodulesIf cystic tumor is mucinous, tumor should be thoroughly, if not entirely, submittedHow many lymph nodes are there, and what is their gross appearance?Histologic SectionsMargins (as above)TumorDemonstrate relationship to ampulla, pancreas, pancreatic duct, common bile duct, and duodenumSection(s) along long axis of bile duct  to include duodenum, ampulla, bile duct, and pancreas all in 1 section can be very helpfulSections of interface between tumor and normal parenchymaSections of normal uninvolved parenchymaAt least 1 section from anterior and posterior halvesSections of ampulla and accessory ampulla if presentIf tumor is close to anterior or posterior surface, include section of inked surface (prior to dissecting for lymph nodes)",

          "ANCILLARY TESTS": "ImmunohistochemistryPositive staining with at least 1 neuroendocrine marker is essential (but not sufficient) for diagnosisChromogranin more specific but less sensitive (~ 75%); synaptophysin has higher sensitivity (> 95%)Insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) is newer marker with sensitivity of 80-90%CD56, CD57 may be positive but less specific for neuroendocrine differentiationOrthopedia homeobox (OTP) is another new marker that has not been widely studiedPancytokeratin, CK7, CK8, CK18, CK19 usually positiveKi-67: Used for gradingImmunohistochemistry for peptide hormonesRarely required for diagnosis; functional tumors diagnosed based on clinical presentation, not immunohistochemistryNonfunctional tumors may stain for multiple peptidesSomatostatin receptor 2A (SSTR2A)Positive in 70-80% of cases; high expression associated with favorable outcomeDecision to treat with somatostatin analogs usually dictated by somatostatin receptor-based imaging rather than immunohistochemistryDAXX/ATRX Genes involved in chromatin remodeling; mutated in 20-40% of pancreatic NETsMutations correlate with loss of immunohistochemical expressionIdentifies NETs with poor prognosis; can help in determining pancreatic origin, as these mutations are not observed in other NETsMetastatic pancreatic NETsPositivity for islet 1 (ISL1), PDX-1, or NESP55 support primary pancreatic NET, but not widely availablePAX8(+) in 50-60% of metastatic pancreatic NETsTTF-1(-); CDX-2(-), or patchy positiveImmunohistochemistry may not be able to confirm pancreatic origin in many cases",
