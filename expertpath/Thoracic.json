crocidolite is more dangerousChrysotile is least potent carcinogen among asbestos fibers and associated with lowest riskSimian virus (SV40) has been associated with development of mesothelioma in some exposed individualsSV40 induces breaks in human DNA strands in human mesothelial cells, inactivating tumor-suppressor genes TP53 and RB1SV40 was found in contaminated polio vaccines during 1950s and 1960s, spreading to millions of peopleRole of latent infection with SV40 for causing malignant mesothelioma still remains to be establishedOther causes of mesothelioma include nonasbestos fiber, erionite (found only in Cappadocia, Turkey), and ionizing radiationEPIDEMIOLOGYAge RangeMalignant mesothelioma can occur in any age group from children to adultsMost prevalent in adults > 60 years of ageSexMarked male predilection (in USA, M:F = 9:1)IncidenceIncidence in men in USA is ~ 20 per 1 million persons per yearIncidence in women in USA is ~ 2-3 per 1 million persons per yearIncidence in other countries is higher; e.g., in Australia and UK, it is ~ 30-40 per 1 million persons per yearCLINICAL IMPLICATIONSClinical PresentationMost common presenting symptoms are recurrent pleural effusions, progressive dyspnea, and chest painConstitutional symptoms include malaise, weight loss, weakness, and fatigueClinical Risk FactorsCertain occupations are associated with higher risk of exposure to asbestosWorkers in shipyard industryWorkers in insulation and heating trades; construction workersWorkers in mining and milling industry of asbestosMarked increase in incidence is observed when risk factors are combined with cigarette smokingPrognostic FactorsHistologic typePure epithelioid mesothelioma is associated with slightly better outcomeSarcomatoid and biphasic mesotheliomas are associated with more aggressive coursePresenting symptoms (chest pain, dyspnea, and weight loss) are associated with worse prognosisYounger age at presentation, low stage, and good performance status are associated with better prognosisMACROSCOPICGeneral FeaturesPleural mesothelioma shows tendency to spread along pleural surfaceInitial manifestation may be as multiple tiny nodules studding visceral or parietal pleuraOver time, nodules enlarge and become confluent, forming plaques and larger nodulesIn more advanced stages, entire pleural surface is covered by rind of tumor that may vary in thicknessTumor tends to invade pleural fissures and infiltrate surface of lung parenchymaTumor eventually spreads to regional and intrathoracic lymph nodesInvasion of chest wall fat and muscle is characteristicSpread through diaphragm can occasionally occur, leading to seeding of peritoneal cavity and ascitesRarely, mesothelioma may grow as localized, sharply circumscribed mass, termed localized malignant mesotheliomaSuch tumors are generally associated with better prognosisCommonly confused for metastatic diseaseMICROSCOPICGeneral FeaturesMalignant mesothelioma is divided histopathologically into epithelioid, sarcomatoid, and mixed (biphasic) typesSpecial histologic variants of mesothelioma include desmoplastic, lymphohistiocytic, and deciduoid typesWell-differentiated papillary mesothelial tumor/mesothelioma is distinct variant with papillary architecture and absence of invasion and indolent behaviorDifferential DiagnosisPrimary differential diagnosis for malignant mesothelioma is with mesothelial hyperplasia as well as metastasis of other epithelioid neoplasms (carcinoma, melanoma, and others)Panel-based approach with multiple markers is recommended for immunohistochemistrySarcomatoid mesothelioma or primary sarcomatoid mesenchymal lesions of pleura must be differentiated from metastasis of mesenchymal lesions;

crocidolite is more dangerousChrysotile is least potent carcinogen among asbestos fibers and associated with lowest riskSimian virus (SV40) has been associated with development of mesothelioma in some exposed individualsSV40 induces breaks in human DNA strands in human mesothelial cells, inactivating tumor-suppressor genes TP53 and RB1SV40 was found in contaminated polio vaccines during 1950s and 1960s, spreading to millions of peopleRole of latent infection with SV40 for causing malignant mesothelioma still remains to be establishedOther causes of mesothelioma include nonasbestos fiber, erionite (found only in Cappadocia, Turkey), and ionizing radiationEPIDEMIOLOGYAge RangeMalignant mesothelioma can occur in any age group from children to adultsMost prevalent in adults > 60 years of ageSexMarked male predilection (in USA, M:F = 9:1)IncidenceIncidence in men in USA is ~ 20 per 1 million persons per yearIncidence in women in USA is ~ 2-3 per 1 million persons per yearIncidence in other countries is higher;
