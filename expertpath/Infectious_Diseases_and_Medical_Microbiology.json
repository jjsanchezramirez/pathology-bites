that multiply by budding of daughter yeast cellsMay form pseudohyphaeMold: Fungus growing as multicellular, often branching, hyphaeHyphae: Branching filaments of molds, which have morphology and growth patterns useful for diagnosisMay be septate or nonseptateConidia: Asexual, nonmotile spores often produced at ends of conidiophores (specialized hyphae, a.k.a. conidiogenous cells)Morphology useful in fungal identificationAnamorph: Asexual form of fungusTeleomorph: Sexual form of fungusHolomorph: Fungus with both sexual and asexual forms presentClinical IssuesGeneralPolicies regarding approach to fungal disease should be created (in collaboration with multidisciplinary team) and provided via institutional messagingFindings of invasive fungal elements should be considered emergency and reported immediately to care team (i.e., critical value)This should include necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, which may represent fungus, mycobacteria, etc.Taxonomy of medically important fungi continues to be updated; clinical microbiology laboratories may choose to report both current and outdated but more recognized namesImmunocompetent HostsFungal organisms, with few exceptions, do not cause severe or life-threatening infections in humans with competent immune systemsCommon mild fungal infections in immunocompetent hosts: Cutaneous candidiasis, genital yeast infections, thrush, paronychia, onychomycosis, dermatophytosis, dermatophytes (e.g., tinea infections) Moderate to severe infections in immunocompetent hosts: Sporotrichosis, mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis, phaeohyphomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosisImmunocompromised HostsVast majority of significant fungal disease in humans occurs in immunocompromised hostsSevere localized infections, as well as small breaks in tissue barriers, can result in dissemination and fungal sepsisMucormycosis, other hyalohyphomycoses, Cryptococcus species, Talaromyces marneffei, and others are primarily observed in immunocompromised hosts as symptomatic infectionsDepending on severity of immune suppression, any fungal species may be able to cause disseminated infectionProper identification of unknown fungus in these hosts may result in rare species without treatment guidelinesLength of time required to identify these species may exceed clinical window for treatmentPart of institutional policies regarding approach to fungal infections should include empiric antifungal guidance based on patient type and historic dataFungal ClassesYeastsBy far, most common fungal organisms (Candida species) isolated from humansTypically grow more rapidly in culture than molds and can grow on many microbiology agarose plates that are for bacteriaExamples: Cryptococcus species, Candida speciesMoldsBy far most common fungal organisms to which humans are exposedPresent in environment, households, food supply, airborne, etc.Inhalation and ingestion are most common exposure mechanismsDisease states can include allergies, chronic pulmonary conditions, mass-forming lesions, invasive disease, and disseminationExamples: Aspergillus species, Mucor species, Fusarium speciesThermally Dimorphic FungiSmall group of human pathogens that grow as yeast in human tissue at 37 °C or as mold at 25 °C in environment or laboratoryCommonly cause human skin infections &/or pulmonary lesions with dissemination in immunocompromised hostsTypically have endemic or geographically restricted distributionsExamples: Coccidioides species, Blastomyces species, T. marneffei, Histoplasma species, Paracoccidioides speciesDematiaceous FungiNaturally pigmented yeasts and molds causing cutaneous and disseminated diseaseCommonly found in environment with history of traumatic penetrations before infectionCause disease spectrum depending on mechanism of exposure and immune status (tinea nigra, chromoblastomycosis, phaeohyphomycosis)Pathologic PatternsNo Tissue ResponseYeast and molds infecting immunocompromised hosts can invade and spread to tissue with minimal tissue reactionNecrosis of tissue secondary to blood vessel compromise &/or infarction may occurSpecial stains to look for fungus in unexplained lesions of immunocompromised are requiredNecrosisAngioinvasion: Leads to vessel compromise and local destruction of tissueInfarction: Upstream vessel occlusion or destruction leads to downstream infarctionAcute Suppurative InflammationNeutrophils are primarily responsive to all fungal elements in immunocompetent hostsCan progress to abscessesChronic InflammationMononuclear inflammationMacrophages &/or lymphocytes may join neutrophils after initial responseGranulomatous inflammationAs acute lesions persist, mononuclear inflammation may form granulomataCan present as small disseminated granuloma or large masses (which can form cavities)Eosinophilic inflammationAlthough uncommon, some fungal infections produce eosinophilia (Coccidioides species)Fungal elements in tissue can cause Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon (sporotrichosis, basidiobolomycosis)Fungus BallMolds and other fungi may colonize preexisting spaces or cavities and form noninvasive fungal masses (lung, nasal passages)There is no hyphal growth into tissue (invasion) surrounding cavityIn immunocompetent hosts with existing fungus ball who become immunosuppressed, invasion and dissemination can occurDiagnostic Approaches to FungusBlood/Body Fluid ExaminationMacrophages containing yeast (Histoplasma species) can be seen in blood, body fluids, and bone marrow aspiratesCerebrospinal fluid examination for yeast (Cryptococcus species) using India ink prep (less sensitive than antigen testing)Candida species commonly isolated from blood and urine, most often as contaminantPositive blood culture bottles for fungus can demonstrate organisms on Gram stainCytology and Fine-Needle AspirationSuspected fungal elements (yeast or hyphae) seen on cytology should be confirmed with culture &/or cell block reviewCan be ideal sample to obtain material for culture &/or molecular analysis for large lesionsTissue BiopsyIdentification of fungal elements in biopsies or surgical resection specimens should be categorized into saprobic or invasiveCorrelation with clinical appearance, clinical history, and surgical appearanceContamination of samples prior to processing and cross contamination from other samples should be excludedDepending on body site, fungal forms may be normal floraInvasive fungal elements, regardless of inflammatory response, should be communicated as critical valueFrozen section and routine H&E may or may not show fungal elementsSilver stains (GMS, MSS) are generally better for morphology (exception: So-called zygomycetes, which may not stain well)PAS-D is generally better for epithelial surfaces and for certain species (i.e., zygomycetes)Mucicarmine and Fontana-Masson stains may be positive in Cryptococcus species (vs. Histoplasma species)Larger yeasts, such as Blastomyces and Coccidioides, may stain with melanin but are morphologically distinctYeast can be diagnosed with some degree of confidence based on size, budding, and histochemical staining propertiesMorphology of hyphal forms is never sufficient to provide diagnosis and should only be used to guide empiric therapy and direct additional testingImmunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, &/or immunofluorescence, when available, can confirm some speciesDifferential diagnosis for hyphae may represent organisms with completely different treatment and variable outcomesConfirmation with culture, special stains, molecular testing, or mass spectrometry is requiredRapid Diagnostic TestsIn acute setting, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can be valuable to guide therapy or monitor outcomes of therapyCryptococcal latex agglutination: Positive in Cryptococcus species and trichosporonosis(1,3)-β-D-glucan: Positive in Aspergillus species, Pneumocystis jirovecii, Candida species, and many other fungi (nonspecific)Galactomannan: Positive in Aspergillus species and, rarely, in other organismsFalse-positive may occur in presence of certain β-lactam antibioticsCultureFungal culture using variety of media has been gold standard for diagnosisRequires media that differentiates fungal forms into morphologically identifiable sexual and asexual forms (evaluated on lactophenol cotton blue-stained slides)Requires variable temperature growth of same fungus to accelerate differentiationMay take several days to weeks to get growth sufficient for identificationDue to acuity of immunocompromised patients, may not represent most optimal method for diagnosisRapid assessment using molecular techniques or mass spectroscopy when colony first forms is highly valuable but requires growthMolecular DiagnosticsSpecific PCR assays (single genus or species detection), inclusion on multitarget syndromic panels, as well as PCR with sequencing, is new gold standard for identificationInternal transcribed spacer (ITS) and D1/D2 region of 28S rRNA gene are primary targets for broad spectrum fungal sequencing; may require genus-specific targets for speciationIn primary samples, may be hindered by contaminants (careful interpretation)In culture samples, may be challenging for extraction (validated methods required)Molecular analysis of tissue after morphologic confirmation of fungal elements is idealMass SpectroscopyHighly specific method of identification of fungi using rapid assay based on protein signatureTypically requires cultured colony (not on primary samples)Significantly less time consuming and less reagent cost for detection (high initial capital cost)",

can be spread by ingestion of prions from infected tissue or receipt of contaminated cadaver-derived tissues/hormones (growth hormone)Autopsy can serve vital role in confirming diagnosis and should be pursued; brain can be examined after adequate formaldehyde fixation (10-14 days) on table covered with absorbent pad and nonpermeable backing (plastic)Disinfect contaminated surfaces by flooding with NaOH or bleach and leaving undisturbed for at least 1 hour; use of disposable instruments recommendedSamples for histology should be labeled [Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) precautions] and placed in 95-100% formic acid for 1 hour, followed by fresh 10% neutral buffered formalin for at least 48 hoursTissue remnants, cutting debris, and contaminated formaldehyde solution should be discarded in water-tight plastic container as infective hospital waste for incinerationMycobacterium tuberculosisAcid-fast bacilli capable of aerosolization; transmitted via inhalation of aerosols and droplets, traumatic inoculation, or introduction into skin through previous lesions or punctures (tuberculosis verrucosa cutis)Active tuberculosis often undiagnosed premortemClinical tip-offs include nonspecific symptomatology, early death, positive IGRA, PPD, pulmonary lesions, presence of epidemiologic risk factors (immigration from endemic areas, history of incarceration)Viable organism isolated 24-48 hours after embalmingFormalin fixation recommended prior to handling tissues; all unfixed tissues need to be manipulated in biologic safety cabinetAdvisable to introduce 10% formalin into lungs through trachea as well as to submerse organs for 24 hours after evisceration and before dissectionReduce aerosolizing procedures (use hand saws in place of power equipment); restrict number of personnel involvedSputum, pus, tissue, and urine samples should be manipulated as little as possible to avoid splashing and aerosol formationMiddle East and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2)Transmitted through inhalation of aerosol droplets or through contaminated surfaces (can persist for up to 72 hours)Perform autopsy in isolation room, limit aerosolizing proceduresPrimary clinical specimens can be handled in BSL-2 laboratory using standard universal precautionsCulture isolates must be handled in BSL-3 laboratoryHepatitis B and CHBV is highly transmissible (100x more transmissible by blood and aerosols than HIV); occupational risk decreased by availability of effective vaccine and postexposure prophylaxisHCV is more transmissible than HIV but less so than HBV; no vaccine or immunoprophylaxis currently availableIndirect transmission possible, as virus persists on surfaces at room temperature for daysEpidemiologic risk factors include injection drug use, hemodialysis patients, history of blood transfusions or organ transplants prior to 1992HIVOccupational transmission usually occurs following accidental needle stick or scalpel injury;

patterns useful for diagnosisMay be septate or nonseptateConidia: Asexual, nonmotile spores often produced at ends of conidiophores (specialized hyphae, a.k.a. conidiogenous cells)Morphology useful in fungal identificationAnamorph: Asexual form of fungusTeleomorph: Sexual form of fungusHolomorph: Fungus with both sexual and asexual forms presentClinical IssuesGeneralPolicies regarding approach to fungal disease should be created (in collaboration with multidisciplinary team) and provided via institutional messagingFindings of invasive fungal elements should be considered emergency and reported immediately to care team (i.e., critical value)This should include necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, which may represent fungus, mycobacteria, etc.Taxonomy of medically important fungi continues to be updated; clinical microbiology laboratories may choose to report both current and outdated but more recognized namesImmunocompetent HostsFungal organisms, with few exceptions, do not cause severe or life-threatening infections in humans with competent immune systemsCommon mild fungal infections in immunocompetent hosts: Cutaneous candidiasis, genital yeast infections, thrush, paronychia, onychomycosis, dermatophytosis, dermatophytes (e.g., tinea infections) Moderate to severe infections in immunocompetent hosts: Sporotrichosis, mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis, phaeohyphomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosisImmunocompromised HostsVast majority of significant fungal disease in humans occurs in immunocompromised hostsSevere localized infections, as well as small breaks in tissue barriers, can result in dissemination and fungal sepsisMucormycosis, other hyalohyphomycoses, Cryptococcus species, Talaromyces marneffei, and others are primarily observed in immunocompromised hosts as symptomatic infectionsDepending on severity of immune suppression, any fungal species may be able to cause disseminated infectionProper identification of unknown fungus in these hosts may result in rare species without treatment guidelinesLength of time required to identify these species may exceed clinical window for treatmentPart of institutional policies regarding approach to fungal infections should include empiric antifungal guidance based on patient type and historic dataFungal ClassesYeastsBy far, most common fungal organisms (Candida species) isolated from humansTypically grow more rapidly in culture than molds and can grow on many microbiology agarose plates that are for bacteriaExamples: Cryptococcus species, Candida speciesMoldsBy far most common fungal organisms to which humans are exposedPresent in environment, households, food supply, airborne, etc.Inhalation and ingestion are most common exposure mechanismsDisease states can include allergies, chronic pulmonary conditions, mass-forming lesions, invasive disease, and disseminationExamples: Aspergillus species, Mucor species, Fusarium speciesThermally Dimorphic FungiSmall group of human pathogens that grow as yeast in human tissue at 37 °C or as mold at 25 °C in environment or laboratoryCommonly cause human skin infections &/or pulmonary lesions with dissemination in immunocompromised hostsTypically have endemic or geographically restricted distributionsExamples: Coccidioides species, Blastomyces species, T. marneffei, Histoplasma species, Paracoccidioides speciesDematiaceous FungiNaturally pigmented yeasts and molds causing cutaneous and disseminated diseaseCommonly found in environment with history of traumatic penetrations before infectionCause disease spectrum depending on mechanism of exposure and immune status (tinea nigra, chromoblastomycosis, phaeohyphomycosis)Pathologic PatternsNo Tissue ResponseYeast and molds infecting immunocompromised hosts can invade and spread to tissue with minimal tissue reactionNecrosis of tissue secondary to blood vessel compromise &/or infarction may occurSpecial stains to look for fungus in unexplained lesions of immunocompromised are requiredNecrosisAngioinvasion: Leads to vessel compromise and local destruction of tissueInfarction: Upstream vessel occlusion or destruction leads to downstream infarctionAcute Suppurative InflammationNeutrophils are primarily responsive to all fungal elements in immunocompetent hostsCan progress to abscessesChronic InflammationMononuclear inflammationMacrophages &/or lymphocytes may join neutrophils after initial responseGranulomatous inflammationAs acute lesions persist, mononuclear inflammation may form granulomataCan present as small disseminated granuloma or large masses (which can form cavities)Eosinophilic inflammationAlthough uncommon, some fungal infections produce eosinophilia (Coccidioides species)Fungal elements in tissue can cause Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon (sporotrichosis, basidiobolomycosis)Fungus BallMolds and other fungi may colonize preexisting spaces or cavities and form noninvasive fungal masses (lung, nasal passages)There is no hyphal growth into tissue (invasion) surrounding cavityIn immunocompetent hosts with existing fungus ball who become immunosuppressed, invasion and dissemination can occurDiagnostic Approaches to FungusBlood/Body Fluid ExaminationMacrophages containing yeast (Histoplasma species) can be seen in blood, body fluids, and bone marrow aspiratesCerebrospinal fluid examination for yeast (Cryptococcus species) using India ink prep (less sensitive than antigen testing)Candida species commonly isolated from blood and urine, most often as contaminantPositive blood culture bottles for fungus can demonstrate organisms on Gram stainCytology and Fine-Needle AspirationSuspected fungal elements (yeast or hyphae) seen on cytology should be confirmed with culture &/or cell block reviewCan be ideal sample to obtain material for culture &/or molecular analysis for large lesionsTissue BiopsyIdentification of fungal elements in biopsies or surgical resection specimens should be categorized into saprobic or invasiveCorrelation with clinical appearance, clinical history, and surgical appearanceContamination of samples prior to processing and cross contamination from other samples should be excludedDepending on body site, fungal forms may be normal floraInvasive fungal elements, regardless of inflammatory response, should be communicated as critical valueFrozen section and routine H&E may or may not show fungal elementsSilver stains (GMS, MSS) are generally better for morphology (exception: So-called zygomycetes, which may not stain well)PAS-D is generally better for epithelial surfaces and for certain species (i.e., zygomycetes)Mucicarmine and Fontana-Masson stains may be positive in Cryptococcus species (vs. Histoplasma species)Larger yeasts, such as Blastomyces and Coccidioides, may stain with melanin but are morphologically distinctYeast can be diagnosed with some degree of confidence based on size, budding, and histochemical staining propertiesMorphology of hyphal forms is never sufficient to provide diagnosis and should only be used to guide empiric therapy and direct additional testingImmunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, &/or immunofluorescence, when available, can confirm some speciesDifferential diagnosis for hyphae may represent organisms with completely different treatment and variable outcomesConfirmation with culture, special stains, molecular testing, or mass spectrometry is requiredRapid Diagnostic TestsIn acute setting, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can be valuable to guide therapy or monitor outcomes of therapyCryptococcal latex agglutination: Positive in Cryptococcus species and trichosporonosis(1,3)-β-D-glucan: Positive in Aspergillus species, Pneumocystis jirovecii, Candida species, and many other fungi (nonspecific)Galactomannan: Positive in Aspergillus species and, rarely, in other organismsFalse-positive may occur in presence of certain β-lactam antibioticsCultureFungal culture using variety of media has been gold standard for diagnosisRequires media that differentiates fungal forms into morphologically identifiable sexual and asexual forms (evaluated on lactophenol cotton blue-stained slides)Requires variable temperature growth of same fungus to accelerate differentiationMay take several days to weeks to get growth sufficient for identificationDue to acuity of immunocompromised patients, may not represent most optimal method for diagnosisRapid assessment using molecular techniques or mass spectroscopy when colony first forms is highly valuable but requires growthMolecular DiagnosticsSpecific PCR assays (single genus or species detection), inclusion on multitarget syndromic panels, as well as PCR with sequencing, is new gold standard for identificationInternal transcribed spacer (ITS) and D1/D2 region of 28S rRNA gene are primary targets for broad spectrum fungal sequencing; may require genus-specific targets for speciationIn primary samples, may be hindered by contaminants (careful interpretation)In culture samples, may be challenging for extraction (validated methods required)Molecular analysis of tissue after morphologic confirmation of fungal elements is idealMass SpectroscopyHighly specific method of identification of fungi using rapid assay based on protein signatureTypically requires cultured colony (not on primary samples)Significantly less time consuming and less reagent cost for detection (high initial capital cost)",

organ manipulation increases exposure to body fluids and blood; use of instruments, hoses, and saws can produce aerosols contaminating environment or allowing inhalationPPE should be used for all autopsies, including scrub suits, gowns, waterproof sleeves, plastic disposable aprons, caps, N95 particulate masks, eye protection (goggles or face shields), shoe covers or footwear restricted to contaminated areas, and double sets of gloves; cut-resistant and puncture-resistant hand protection (plastic or steel gloves) recommendedUse of \"isolation\" room for postmortem examinations with potential for pathogens of concern: Hantavirus, hepatitis, HIV/AIDs, leprosy, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA, VRE), rickettsial diseases, typhoid fever, systemic infections of unknown etiologyIsolation rooms should limit personnel, use strictly enforced universal precautions, and include additional special safety and decontamination procedures as indicated; consider use of overhead ultraviolet lights for secondary decontaminationAdditional efforts to reduce aerosols should be included for pathogens spread by aerosol/droplet Tuberculosis, meningococcal meningitis, SARS, influenza, rabies, Yersinia pestis (plague), legionellosis, meningococcemia, rickettsioses, coccidiomycosis, prion disease, and anthraxConsiderations include collecting body cavity fluids in ladle or bulb syringe instead of hose aspirator, placing plastic bags over decedent head during removal of calvarium, using saws equipped with HEPA filters, moistening bone before cuttingConsider less hazardous sampling and testing methodologies to arrive at diagnosis: Molecular detection of viral hemorrhagic fevers using skin fragment or respiratory viruses (SARS, influenza) using nasopharyngeal swabsSurgical Pathology Routine use of PPE should be used for grossing specimens (scrub suits, gowns, waterproof sleeves, plastic disposable aprons, face shields/goggles)It is recommended to gross specimens with concern for infective agents in biosafety cabinet, particularly when risk of spatter or aerosolization presentFrozen section considerations includeUse of N95 or respiratory mask during tissue sectioning, as cryostats may produce aerosolesAvoid use of freezing sprays and propellantsPerform regular cryostat decontamination with 70% ethyl or isopropyl alcoholObtain cultures as indicated, and alert microbiology laboratory if concern for highly infectious organism or agent of bioterrorismCytologyRoutine use of PPE on-site during proceduresFine-needle aspiration procedures and making smears can cause aerosolsAir-dried slides are infectious;

can be spread by ingestion of prions from infected tissue or receipt of contaminated cadaver-derived tissues/hormones (growth hormone)Autopsy can serve vital role in confirming diagnosis and should be pursued; brain can be examined after adequate formaldehyde fixation (10-14 days) on table covered with absorbent pad and nonpermeable backing (plastic)Disinfect contaminated surfaces by flooding with NaOH or bleach and leaving undisturbed for at least 1 hour; use of disposable instruments recommendedSamples for histology should be labeled [Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) precautions] and placed in 95-100% formic acid for 1 hour, followed by fresh 10% neutral buffered formalin for at least 48 hoursTissue remnants, cutting debris, and contaminated formaldehyde solution should be discarded in water-tight plastic container as infective hospital waste for incinerationMycobacterium tuberculosisAcid-fast bacilli capable of aerosolization; transmitted via inhalation of aerosols and droplets, traumatic inoculation, or introduction into skin through previous lesions or punctures (tuberculosis verrucosa cutis)Active tuberculosis often undiagnosed premortemClinical tip-offs include nonspecific symptomatology, early death, positive IGRA, PPD, pulmonary lesions, presence of epidemiologic risk factors (immigration from endemic areas, history of incarceration)Viable organism isolated 24-48 hours after embalmingFormalin fixation recommended prior to handling tissues; all unfixed tissues need to be manipulated in biologic safety cabinetAdvisable to introduce 10% formalin into lungs through trachea as well as to submerse organs for 24 hours after evisceration and before dissectionReduce aerosolizing procedures (use hand saws in place of power equipment); restrict number of personnel involvedSputum, pus, tissue, and urine samples should be manipulated as little as possible to avoid splashing and aerosol formationMiddle East and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2)Transmitted through inhalation of aerosol droplets or through contaminated surfaces (can persist for up to 72 hours)Perform autopsy in isolation room, limit aerosolizing proceduresPrimary clinical specimens can be handled in BSL-2 laboratory using standard universal precautionsCulture isolates must be handled in BSL-3 laboratoryHepatitis B and CHBV is highly transmissible (100x more transmissible by blood and aerosols than HIV); occupational risk decreased by availability of effective vaccine and postexposure prophylaxisHCV is more transmissible than HIV but less so than HBV; no vaccine or immunoprophylaxis currently availableIndirect transmission possible, as virus persists on surfaces at room temperature for daysEpidemiologic risk factors include injection drug use, hemodialysis patients, history of blood transfusions or organ transplants prior to 1992HIVOccupational transmission usually occurs following accidental needle stick or scalpel injury;
