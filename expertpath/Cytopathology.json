tests analyze DNA, mRNA, miRNA, or lncRNA to detect genes of interestFGFR3 and TERT genes are common targets, but also many others depending on specific testSome target methylation or microsatellite instabilityCommercial mRNA tests include CxBladder Detect and Xpert Bladder Cancer MonitorPotential to replace cytology for screening, at least in some circumstancesNongenetic TargetsVesicle concentration or contents may be analyzedProteins may also be targetedSensitivity Improvement ConsiderationsLow-Grade Papillary NeoplasmsIn Paris System, almost all low-grade papillary neoplasms will be called negativeThese tests may be able to detect some low-grade lesions \"missed\" by cytology, but not allClinical utility of finding such low-grade lesions is questionableHigh-Grade Urothelial CarcinomaIncreased sensitivity would be most useful in setting of screening for hematuria or monitoring for recurrenceExisting ancillary tests are limited by significant numbers of false-positives and false-negativesTheoretically, biomarkers could replace cystoscopy for follow-up, but no such testing protocol has yet been widely adoptedDecades of research have not found markers obviously superior to cytology when all factors, including cost of increased follow-up, are consideredTriage of equivocal cytology results is important application for FISH",

limited to very rare groups of cells in otherwise benign sampleThese could be in background of Hashimoto thyroiditis or multinodular goiterExtensive but mild cytologic atypiaMost cells have mildly enlarged, slightly pale nuclei with limited contour irregularity and absent intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusionsCyst contents and atypical cyst lining cellsAtypia in cyst lining cells beyond what is normally expected in cyst aspirations or cystic nodulesMinor component of cells with nuclear elongation, grooves, cleared/powdery chromatin, raising concern for papillary carcinoma but not sufficient for diagnosis of \"suspicious for malignancy\"Histiocytoid cells (concern for cystic papillary carcinoma)Larger than usual for true histiocytes, either isolated or in microfollicles or clustersRound nuclei, high N:C ratio, and glassy/hard cytoplasm (compared to true histiocytes)Absence of hemosiderin in cytoplasm (unlike histiocytes)Large discrete vacuolization of cytoplasm (unlike fine vacuoles of histiocytes)Staining of cytospins or cell block may help (CD68 and cytokeratin)Architectural Atypia (Lower Risk of Malignancy)Scant cellularity with rare clusters of microfollicles/trabeculaeCellularity too low for diagnosis of follicular neoplasm/suspicious for follicular neoplasmHowever, architecture cannot be ignored, precluding diagnosis as nondiagnostic specimenCellular specimen with focal prominence of microfolliclesCellular specimen, but proportion of microfollicles not sufficient for diagnosis of follicular neoplasm, though more than what would be expected with adenomatous noduleBenign adenomatous nodule findings on most passes, but 1 pass shows microfollicular patternCytologic and Architectural Atypia (Higher Risk of Malignancy)Mild but diffuse cytologic and architectural atypia [may be seen with follicular subtype of papillary carcinoma (FSPTC) or noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP)]Oncocytic (Hürthle Cell) Aspirates (Lower Risk of Malignancy)Predominance of oncocytic (Hürthle) cellsIn setting that suggests lymphocytic/Hashimoto thyroiditis or adenomatous nodule from multinodular goiterClinically lymphocytic thyroiditis but lymphocytes are absent and only Hürthle cells presentClinically multinodular goiter, but aspirate yields predominant population of oncocytic cellsPredominant or exclusive population of Hürthle/oncocytic cells in sparsely cellular specimen with scant colloid but insufficient for definitive diagnosis of Hürthle cell neoplasmAtypia, Not Otherwise SpecifiedRare/minor population of follicular cells with nuclear enlargement accompanied by nucleoliThese changes could be from radioactive iodine, carbimazole, or others, but history may not be availablePsammoma bodies in absence of nuclear features of PTCLamellar bodies of inspissated colloid may be mistaken for psammoma bodiesSmall globules of thick colloid in liquid-based preparations may also mimic psammoma bodiesPositive predictive value (PPV) for psammoma bodies in thyroid aspirates is ~ 50%;

sites> 100 known types differentiated by L1 gene that encodes viral capsidE6 and E7 are other key genes that inhibit apoptosis to facilitate viral survival by blocking Rb, p53, and p21, leading to carcinogenesisLow-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) is human papillomavirus (HPV) viral cytopathic effect and corresponds to production of viral particlesHigh-risk HPV types can be incorporated into host genome and may result in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or carcinomaTestingResidual fluid from liquid-based Pap tests can be used for molecular testing to detect HPVSelf-collection kits for HPV screening without associated cytologyRecently FDA approved in USA (Cobas and Onclarity)Movement toward self-collection in many developed countriesRequires a means of triage for positive screens, either clinician-collected samples for cytology or reflex molecular testingMay be key to expanding cervical cancer screening to countries without well-established cytologic screening programsFDA approval is important for acceptance of molecular testing in USA, though in other countries less regulation is in placeTarget amplification methodsPCR (Cobas, Onclarity, and Alinity M)Segments of DNA are repeatedly copied and recopied by polymerase enzymes to produce large numbers of target genetic sequenceRequires temperature cycling to create new copies at lower temperature then release them for recopying at higher temperatureRNA can be detected by PCR if reverse transcription is used first to convert RNA into DNAFluorescent molecules can be used to monitor production of copies for quantitationNucleic acid sequence-based amplification (PreTect, HPV Proofer, and NucliSENS EasyQ)Uses reverse transcription to create DNA copy of target RNA followed by selective degradation of RNA and creation of double-stranded DNA from DNA copyDouble-stranded DNA is transcribed into numerous copies of RNA, each of which can then be converted to DNA and then to more RNA, resulting in amplificationHas advantage of being able to proceed at fixed temperature, unlike PCRTranscription-mediated amplification (TMA) (Aptima)Target RNA is captured by complementary oligomers attached to magnetic particleMagnetization of specimen captures RNA and allows for removal of extraneous nucleic acidsReverse transcription of magnet-captured RNA creates DNA that is copied and recopiedDNA copies bind to chemiluminescent probes and are detected by luminometerThese methods offer high sensitivityProduce many copies of target that can contaminate laboratory and lead to false-positive resultsNewer, highly automated versions require less technical skill and reduce contamination problemsFalse-positives still occur due to carry-over between vialsFalse-negative results are less rare than commonly assumed, due to causes includingInterfering substances (blood, lubricants, antifungal creams, etc.)Scant infected cellsLow copy numbers of HPV in cellsSignal amplification methodsHybrid capture technique (Hybrid Capture II)Target DNA attaches to HPV type-specific RNA probesAntibodies against DNA-RNA hybrids, attached to microplate wells, capture targets and allow for removal of extraneous DNAProbes directed against DNA-RNA hybrids with attached alkaline phosphatase enzymes then indicate presence of target by reacting with chemiluminescent substratesEach captured DNA results in release of many chemiluminescent signalsInvader technique (Cervista)Overlapping probes target HPV DNA, resulting in segment that cannot bind and is cleavedMany such cleaved segments result from binding to each targetEach of these segments can then combine with multiple fluorescence resonance energy transfer cassettes, resulting in fluorescent signalSignal amplification does not result in increased target nucleic acids, eliminating contamination problemDuring early years of HPV testing, Hybrid Capture technique offered combination of ease of use and FDA approval that led to its widespread adoptionHybrid Capture II has been replaced by newer technologies, but is still important as benchmarkHPV typingHigh-risk types for carcinogenesis: 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68Clinical HPV tests focus on detection of these typesSome tests examine L1 gene to maximize sensitivitySome tests target E6/E7 genes because they are more directly related to risk of malignant progression; therefore, higher specificityTypes 16 and 18 are especially common and virulent; triage tests for just these 2 types allow for more aggressive follow-upExtended genotyping gives type-specific information beyond types 16 and 18, allowing for differential triage of other high-risk typesHPV in situ hybridization staining directed at high-risk types is also availableLow-risk types that do not progress to cancer: 6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 70, 72, 81, and CP6108Testing for these types is discouraged but availableOther types have intermediate or

undetermined significance (ASC-US)ASC-US with high-risk HPV positivity has follow-up biopsy rates of high-grade dysplasia similar to LSILHigh-risk HPV-negative results are frequently reactiveHPV-positive rates in ASC-US can be used as quality assurance and feedback measure in cytology laboratoriesHigh-risk HPV cotesting with cytology in women ≥ 30 years of ageNegative HPV test results combined with negative cytology indicate very low risk of high-grade dysplasiaAllows for extended (3-5 year) screening intervals for double-negative womenLess common usesAs cotest with cytology after negative or low-grade follow-up colposcopy and biopsy following abnormal cytology, HPV-16 or 18 positivity, or persistent high-risk HPV positivityAs cotest with cytology after excision for high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma in situ as a test of cureNot recommended in young womenIf screening women below 25 years of age, cytology is preferred to HPV testingRationale for guidelines: HPV infection rates are high in young women, but high-grade lesions are infrequentPrimary high-risk HPV screening without cytology or with cytology triageMolecular testing is more readily automated and centralized than cytologyMany industrialized countries are adopting HPV-based screening strategiesHPV vaccination reduces prevalence of cervical cancer precursor lesions, making cytology screening less effectiveMolecular testing, with its increased sensitivity, can overcome this problemReduced prevalence of high-risk HPV in population also means fewer false-positives for molecular testingReferrals to colposcopy may still increase with this strategy, however, limiting its applicationCobas, Onclarity, and Alinity M have been FDA approved for primary screeningThis strategy has yet to achieve widespread acceptance in USAHowever, HPV primary screening every 5 years has been endorsed as preferred option by American Cancer Society for women ages 25-64HPV-based methods may allow screening to be extended into countries without established cytology workforceThese methods remain too expensive for most developing countriesFollow-UpHPV is not treated; only HPV-induced lesions areTherefore, knowledge of HPV status is useful only to assess riskTreatment algorithms are moving toward new paradigm of risk-based management2019 ASCCP management guidelines take into account past screening results as well as current resultsFollow-up decisions are based on immediate and 5-year risk of CIN3+CIN3+ includes cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3, adenocarcinoma in situ, and invasive carcinomaCIN3 was chosen as cutoff due to greater specificity for risk of invasive carcinoma than CIN grade 2 or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) as wholeDetermination of follow-up is responsibility of treating physician, requiring use of app or ASCCP websitePrior screening results unknown to cytology lab may impact follow-upAlgorithms are too complicated to memorize, unlike previous versionsASCCP intends to update app/website as new data and new technologies become available, altering algorithm incrementally without waiting to officially announce changes every few years4% risk of immediate CIN3+ is most significant risk level cutoff pointWomen with ≥ 4% risk go to colposcopy (or possibly expedited treatment if risk > 25%)4% cutoff approximates risk of single HPV-positive ASC-US screening resultIf immediate risk < 4%, follow-up screening is determined by 5-year risk of CIN 3+Return to screening may be in 1, 3, or 5 years depending on risk levelRescreening at 1 year is now recommended instead of colposcopy for many women with single positive screening result5-year intervals are recommended for women with negative HPV or cotesting and no prior positive

resulting in infertility or ectopic pregnancyDisseminated disease rarely occursTestingSpecific cervicovaginal swabs are preferred for female molecular testingResidual fluid from Pap testing is acceptableFacilitates screening because only 1 specimen needs to be collectedLess sensitive than specific swabsUrine and urethral, rectal, and oropharyngeal swabs can also be testedMany molecular testing platforms allow for testing of chlamydia and gonorrheaPCR, TMA, and signal amplification methods are available, and many have FDA approvalMany of these are designed to run in parallel to HPV testing on same platformPlatforms include Aptima, Cobas, Onclarity, and Alinity MCulture is gold standard, but molecular methods are more sensitiveIndicationsIn USA, chlamydia screening is recommended for pregnant women, sexually active women ≤ 25 years of age, and women with new or multiple sex partnersCost effectiveness of widespread screening is not yet proven, and many countries only do opportunistic testingChlamydia and gonorrhea are often tested and treated togetherFollow-UpIn low-prevalence populations (older women, 1 partner), probability of false-positive molecular test may be higher than probability of true-positive results, necessitating confirmatory testingChlamydia is treated by single dose of azithromycin in most casesGonorrhea has extensive antibiotic resistanceCeftriaxone plus azithromycin is current preferred treatmentSexual partners should be notified, tested, and treatedBlood tests for other sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV and syphilis, may be warrantedInfectious Vaginitis/CervicitisBiology and EpidemiologyBacterial vaginosisGardnerella vaginalis (anaerobic gram-variable small coccobacilli responsible for clue cells)Other

it successfully revealed timing of ovulation in this animal modelGrading Degrees of Cytomorphologic AlterationPapanicolaou's observations of cell types and their correlation with histology and physiologically relevant processes was published in American Journal of Anatomy (1917)Arguably, 1st literature describing detailed cytologic concepts and methodsPublication displayed photomicrographs, hence established morphology-based interpretive cytologyPapanicolaou introduced features of cell types, including descriptions of their overall morphologyNamely, cytoplasmic and nuclear detail, and how these were periodically altered by inflammatory cells and changing background milieu throughout guinea pig menstrual stagesBased on meticulous data collection, Papanicolaou introduced terms, initiating 1st cytologic vocabularyDescribed specific words and phrasesConsistency of vaginal fluid; pyknotic nuclei; weak affinity for plasma stains; degenerated; reticular structure; cornified; leukocytic digestion of nuclei; atypical desquamated cellsProposed likely significance of these entitiesTerm atypical implied detection of cells with morphology differing from that of other equivalent cell types, but beyond certain morphologic marginEssentially, cytomorphology surpassing that of arbitrarily defined thresholdsThese texts represented 1st likely attempt at grading degrees of cytomorphology, with descriptions of staining reactions relevant to gradingPapanicolaou was intrigued by subtle changes in cytomorphology as detected through H&E stainingBy 1917, he was able to identify various degrees of nuclear and protoplasmic degeneration through contrasting coloration in cornified and noncornified cellsHe was able to relate mosaics of cytomorphology with specific biological processesOf significance was Papanicolaou's ability to correlate his observations with histological and physiological processes in vaginal and uterine epitheliaThese realizations cemented concept of cytology as potential resource in clinical settingClinical ApplicationIn 1919, Papanicolaou directed his attention toward his wife, from whom he started collecting vaginal fluid samples daily (and subsequently for 21 years)Given her precise cycling, Papanicolaou established baseline, physiologically normal, gynecological cytomorphology and studied effects of aging upon human epithelial cellsFrom this long-term study, he perfected fixation and coloration of epithelial cells through Pap-staining methodIt was against her predictable cytomorphology that Papanicolaou subsequently learned to grade atypical cellsBetween 1920 and 1925, Papanicolaou exclusively studied samples collected from his wifeBeginning in February 1925, he analyzed samples collected from other female volunteers (from New York City Women's Hospital) to study hormonal cycling and vaginal cytologyThis work allowed him to study other cell-type combinations and inflammatory cell effects upon epithelial cells from females of variable ages and hormonal statusVariable hormonal status not previously encountered (i.e., pregnancy, post partum, abortion, menopause)Despite complexity of human vaginal cytology, he published successive reports describing ovarian hormone cytologyIn addition to analyzing samples from asymptomatic females, Papanicolaou included pathologic cases from whom he obtained preoperative vaginal fluid samplesIt was inevitable that he would eventually notice abnormal cells arising from cervical cancerCervical Cancer CellsNew cancer diagnosisIdentification of cancer cells intrigued Papanicolaou, yet it posed new challengesHe encountered cytomorphologic features differing substantially from those of normal cellsCancer cells exceeded cytomorphologic thresholds of normal cells he envisioned with unlike staining reactionsNevertheless, Papanicolaou learned to identify abnormal, exfoliated epithelial cells representing cervical cancer indirectlyBased on their unique features, he felt their detection was confidently indicative of malignancyHe published these conclusions in landmark report titled \"New Cancer Diagnosis\" in January 1928Papanicolaou expanded cytomorphologic vocabulary to emphasize differences between benign and malignant squamous cellsPapanicolaou introduced original conceptsEpithelial cytomorphology is related to variable bacterial flora seen in femalesBenign conditions such as myomas are impossible to diagnose by vaginal smear since all cells are normalMalignant cervical lesions yield cells showing cancerous modificationsThese include crowding of cells; large, disproportionate nuclei relative to protoplasm; very dark, dense, fragmented nucleiCancer cells are typically surrounded by robust leukomonocytic phagocytic reaction of organism itselfHis report received little notice and generated limited enthusiasm, all of which discouraged PapanicolaouVaginal smear was regarded as superfluous by leading pathologistsThus, for next 10 years, Papanicolaou studied primarily hormonal cytopathology with Dr. Ephraim ShorrHe described application of vaginal smear to identify human endocrinological imbalancesDiagnostic Value of Vaginal Smears in Carcinoma of UterusIn 1939, Dr. Stockard was succeeded by Dr. Joseph Hinsey, who was impressed by Papanicolaou's work on vaginal smear methodHinsey encouraged Papanicolaou to reevaluate efficacy of his method for detection of cervical cancerInvited Dr. Herbert F. Traut, Head of Gynecologic Oncology at Cornell, to collaborateTo generate needed material, they invited all female patients admitted for gynecological consultation at New York Hospital to receive cervicovaginal fluid samplingCollaboration between Papanicolaou and Traut produced seminal publications documenting effectiveness of vaginal smear method in detecting early cervical cancerHowever, it was generally felt that overall method needed additional evaluationTheir 1st report, \"The Diagnostic Value of Vaginal Smears in Carcinoma of the Uterus\" in 1941, attracted funding from Commonwealth Fund for ongoing trialsGifted artist, Hashime Murayama, helped illustrate their findingsPap Test PopularizationVarious studies were published, confirming that vaginal smear method was capable of detecting occult cervical cancers1st medical and scientific director of American Cancer Society, Dr. Charles S. Cameron, was instrumental for popularization of Pap testPap test received greater recognition and application following introduction of wooden spatula by Dr. J. Ernest AyreThis allowed direct sampling of cervical epithelia under visualization as opposed to collecting vaginal fluid containing randomly exfoliated epithelial cellsBy late 1950s, as recommended by American Cancer Society and demanding public and gynecologists, Pap test became recognized, standard health serviceResulted in systematic mass-screening practices to detect cervical disease precursor to cancerIn 1957, Papanicolaou (professor emeritus at time) retired from Cornell Medical College after 43 years of uninterrupted serviceHe maintained grueling pace of cytologic work and consultation until his death at age 78, on February 18, 1962, of myocardial infarctionOriginal Terminology of Pap-Staining MethodPapanicolaou StainPapanicolaou had encountered another impasse: Aqueous H&E staining posed significant limitationStaining of cells in cancer cases was too deep to permit sharp definition of their outlines in smears that were relatively thick or contained much bloodTerm deep implied opaqueness, hence problematic differentiation of subtle alterations in epithelial cells reflecting metabolic and physiologic changesPapanicolaou experimented with aqueous hematoxylin and alcoholic counter stainsHe then discovered that alcoholic fixation and counter staining resulted in nuclear and cytoplasmic transparencyMulticolor Pap-staining method was thus developed, providing superior delineation of cytomorphologyPapanicolaou and Traut published their findings in \"A New Procedure for Staining Vaginal Smears\" in 1942With this report, terms acidophilic and basophilic 1st appeared to reflect rainbow of hues apparent in cornified and noncornified squamous cellsCollaborators published refinements of Papanicolaou staining method in 1943In 1943, after analyzing thousands of cases, Papanicolaou and Traut published remarkable monograph, \"Diagnosis of Uterine Cancer by the Vaginal Smear\"Decisively changed course of eventsMr. Murayama's contribution was vital for establishment of Pap testArtistic and scientific nature of gynecologic cytopathology appeared in vivid color for 1st timeIntroduced were new cytologic terms and phrases accompanied by spectacular cytomorphologic images rendered in watercolor by Mr. MurayamaEmphasized concepts of atypical cells, grades, and differentiation of carcinoma, intradermal carcinoma, and early noninvasive (incipient) cervical carcinomaThese lesions could be discovered by vaginal smear method earlier than may be possible through biopsyJust after its release, distinguished Dr. James Ewing died of urinary bladder cancerThough he was skeptic of Papanicolaou's work, he endorsed method before his death, escalating overall energyFirst National Cytology ConferenceBoston (1948)Conclusions reached by Papanicolaou and Traut were reproduced by other investigatorsYet vaginal smear method remained unappealing to most pathologistsTherefore, in 1945, newly established American Cancer Society initiated campaign to educate profession regarding effectiveness of methodPapanicolaou felt that instruction should ensue from 1 sourceThus, he organized and taught 1st tutorial in exfoliative cytology in New York Cornell Medical Center in September 1947In response, American Cancer Society sponsored 1st National Cytology Conference in Boston in 1948Resolved that despite optional biopsy, vaginal smear method was sufficient to detect early uterine cancer before it was obvious and before emergence of cervical cancer symptomsPapanicolaou remained concerned over any widespread sampling in absence of greater interpretive knowledge and acceptance amongst practicing pathologists and cytologistsPap Class Reporting SystemIntroduced in 1948Smear technique coupled with Pap staining gained acceptance in realm of diagnostic nongynecologic cytopathology (i.e., urine, sputum, gastric, effusion, and breast)Though, emergence of particular false-negative and false-positive cases disturbed Papanicolaou immenselyIt occurred to him that method and its widening application required dedicated language by which to communicate both cytomorphology and ensuing diagnosisIn 1948, Papanicolaou introduced reporting system based on 5 arbitrary, ill-defined categories by which vaginal smears may be classified1st reporting system designed for gynecologic cytology, later named Papanicolaou Classification System (a.k.a. Pap Class System)Reporting categories communicated sense of confidence as to whether smears reflected malignancySuggested single, linear cascade of epithelial cell abnormalities arising from normal to cancerous epithelia5 classes (I, II, III, IV, and V) conveyed following findingsI: NormalII: InflammatoryIII: Suspicious of malignancyIV: Strongly suggestive of malignancyV: Definitely malignantAtlas of Exfoliative CytologyPublished in 1954Despite new reporting strategy, Papanicolaou realized yet another deficiency as reporting classifications lacked cytomorphologic reflectionTherefore, he and Hashime Murayama embarked upon fundamental work leading up to their magnum opus\"The Atlas of Exfoliative Cytology,\" published in 1954 by Commonwealth Fund, Harvard University PressRemains masterpiece composed of remarkable color plates of cells defining Pap classifications and their relevant cytomorphologic terms, mosaics, and marginsEmphasized ongoing refinement of Papanicolaou staining procedureDysplasia Reporting SystemFormalized in 1962Diagnostic data that emerged from cervical cancer screening programs suggested that precursor lesions differed from invasive cancerPrecursor lesions occur in younger femalesNot all precursor lesions progress to invasive cancerUntreated lesions do not necessarily advance to cancerSome precursor lesions regressPrecursor lesions demonstrate variable cytologic and histologic characteristics, hence gradesThese revelations came soon after Papanicolaou's deathDr. James Reagan formalized Dysplasia Reporting System in 1962His reporting system was designed upon premise that dysplasia is neoplastic, intraepithelial, cervical lesion (of various grades) of uncertain prognosis, in contrast with carcinoma in situ (CIS), which he regarded obligate precursor lesion to invasive cervical cancerIn contrast to Pap class system, Reagan's approach suggested distinct categories of intraepithelial lesionsAlthough dysplasia nomenclature became accepted by most pathologists, others objectedArgued that system could not adequately distinguish carcinoma in situ (CIS) from likely high-grade lesions with surface differentiationDysplasia nomenclature was associated with poor interobserver reproducibilityCervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Reporting SystemProposed in 1967It was also becoming evident that regardless of morphologic appearance, any precursor cervical lesion may potentially progress to invasive cancerBut frequency of likely progression may differ between low- and high-grade lesionsUnderstanding of cervical pathobiology prompted Dr. R. M. Richart to propose alternate approach in 1967Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) reporting systemNomenclature consisted initially of 3 CIN grades: CIN 1 (slight/mild dysplasia), CIN 2 (moderate dysplasia), and CIN 3 (severe dysplasia and CIS)Essentially, CIN 3 category reflected high-grade lesion with strong likelihood of progression to invasive cancerBy combining severe dysplasia with CIS, it simplified oftentimes difficult differentiation between these dysplastic cellsThe Bethesda System for ReportingNational Cancer Institute Conference (1988)Both dysplasia and CIN reporting systems reflected perception of cervical pathobiologic continuum through to invasive cervical cancerAll of these reporting systems featured ill-defined cytologic interpretive categories, yet discriminated koilocytotic atypia from true precursor dysplastic lesionsNevertheless, cervicovaginal smear method (i.e., conventional Pap test) was effective as screening tool despite its technical and reporting limitationsRecognition of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical carcinogenesis stimulated new insightsThere was also need for uniform reporting language linking cytologic interpretations and practitioner follow-upNational Cancer Institute convened conference in 1988 resulting in The Bethesda System (TBS) for reportingFeatured 2 groups of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions based on biologic behavior of HPV infection and specific subtypes involvedIntroduced bipartite concept of cervical precursor neoplasia: Low-grade and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL and HSIL, respectively)2 distinct biologic entities rather than initially perceived biologic continuumAlso intended to improve interobserver and intraobserver variability by reducing diagnostic categoriesLSIL reflected mild dysplasia and CIN 1; HSIL + moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, and CIS, i.e., CIN 2 and 3Introduced means to communicate atypical, inconclusive findings/diagnostic uncertainty1st reporting system to address phenomenon of cytomorphologic overlap possible between benign cellular changes and dysplastic cellular changesThis problem now reported through specific phrasingAtypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H)Atypical glandular cells (AGC)Also advocated definitions and diagnostic criteria of reporting categories and recommended follow-up and patient managementThe Bethesda System for Reporting Cervicovaginal Cytology (2001 and 2015 Versions, Which Are Nearly Same)Specimen adequacySatisfactory for evaluation (mention presence or absence of endocervical/transformation zone)Unsatisfactory for evaluation (specify reason)Specimen rejected/not processed (specify reason)Specimen processed and examined but unsatisfactory for evaluation of epithelial cell abnormality (specify reason)General categorization (optional)Negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM)Epithelial cell abnormalityOtherInterpretationNILMOrganismsTrichomonas vaginalisFungal organisms, morphologically consistent with Candida speciesShift in flora suggestive of bacterial vaginosisBacteria morphologically consistent with Actinomyces speciesCellular changes consistent with herpes simplex virusNonneoplastic findings (optional to report)Reactive cellular changes associated with inflammation (including typical repair)Radiation changes, follicular cervicitis, metaplasias, keratotic changesIntrauterine contraceptive device-related changesAtrophy and atrophic vaginitisGlandular cells status post hysterectomyEndometrial cells in females ≥ 45 yearsSpecify if negative for squamous intraepithelial lesion or malignancyEpithelial cell abnormalitiesSquamous cellAtypical squamous cellsOf undetermined significance (ASC-US)Cannot rule out high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H)LSIL encompassing HPV/mild dysplasia/CIN 1HSIL encompassing moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ;

Current acceptance is low and most prefer co-testing in females over 30 yearsHPV VaccinationProphylactic vaccines (bivalent, quadrivalent, and more recently against 9 HR-HPV types) have been available in past decadeClinical results are very promising for preventing infection by types 16, 18, 6, and 11, and moreSome cross protection against related types also notedHPV vaccination recommended for girls and boys between ages 9-12 in USARisk-based screening strategy using history, Pap, and HPV results in USAWhether colposcopy will remain gold standard remains to be seen once large lesions from types 16 and 18 are eradicatedEvolution of Pap TestConventional Smear to Liquid-Based CytologySince its inception, conventional vaginal smear Pap test has undergone technical metamorphosis in parallel with expanding application and reporting language evolutionExfoliated cells in cervical secretions, or those physically removed from cervical epithelia by collection devices, may be rinsed, suspended, and wet-fixed in preservative reagentsThereafter, may be processed yielding randomized populations of cells placed onto glass slides through dedicated automated systemsLiquid-based technology also supports computerized image-based detection and categorization of abnormal cells by minimizing obscuration by blood, mucus, and inflammatory cellsPotentially improving observer confidence, diagnostic accuracy, and productivityHPV and other molecular testing from residual in vial became feasiblePrimary HR-HPV screening1st FDA approved test in USA in 2014Parts of Australia and Europe and UK already moved to primary HPV screening with cytology as triage; USA starting to move to primary HPV screenCurrently more expensive than cytology but prices anticipated to dropSelf collection and rapid HPV testing trials in low-resource settings underway and initial results appear to be promising",

TechniquesCytocentrifugationAssessment of specimen: Macroscopic examination of specimen is used to select processing protocol (e.g., bloody, thick, watery, etc.)Initial centrifugation: 5 minutes at 2,200 RPM; pour off supernatantCritical resuspension of cell button: Depends on size of cell buttonResuspend in balanced electrolyte solution (RPMI) until slightly hazy suspensionLoading cytospin chambers: Sample chambers hold maximum of 0.5 mL (~ 20 drops) and ≥ 0.1 mL (~ 5-6 drops) should be usedLoad enough drops so cells will not dry out during spin; filter will absorb excess liquidGood cytospin preparation has monolayer of cells in tight cytospin circleCellular assessment slide: Diff-Quik stain can be done on cytospin to check thickness of preparationNumber of drops can be adjusted to increase or decrease cell distributionThinPrep nongynecologic processingInitial spin in CytoLyt: 5 minutes at 2,200 RPMEvaluate cell pellet appearance: If cell pellet is not free of blood, mucus,

PrepStain instrument according to guidelinesThinPrep and SurePath gynecologic processingFollow exact manufacturer-recommended protocolStaining MethodsRegressive staining (Pap stain)Alcohol- or spray-fixed slides must be hydrated in preparation for aqueous hematoxylin stain (10 dips or 30 seconds)Nucleus is overstained in Harris hematoxylin for 2 minutes and then rinsed in running waterTo remove excess hematoxylin, slides are immersed in diluted HCl (1%) for 1-2 quick dips and then rinsed with waterMild hydrochloric acid dip causes lysis of red blood cells; this is advantageous for bloody FNA slides and other bloody prepsSlides are dehydrated in 95% alcohol to prepare for cytoplasmic staining2 minutes in OG stain and 5 minutes in mixture of EA 50/65 with alcohol rinses in betweenFinal dehydration in 100% alcoholClearing with xylene will prepare slides for mounting mediumProgressive staining (Pap)Alcohol- or spray-fixed slides must be hydrated with water in preparation

histological and clinical findingsRetrospective Reviews (GYN)For each patient with current/new HSIL or Ca, laboratory must review all normal or negative GYN specimens received within previous 5 yearsIf significant discrepancies are found that would affect current patient care, laboratory must notify patient's physician and issue revised reportFor NGYN and FNAB, certain percentage of cases can be retrospectively reviewed for interpretation and other variances (to be defined by laboratory)Measures of Screening PerformanceRescreening of ≥ 10% of each cytotechnologist's GYN cases that have been interpreted as negativeRequired for laboratories subjected to CLIA '88 regulationsShould be performed by cytotechnologist supervisor with ≥ 3 years of full-time experience within preceding 10 years or designee who meets requirementsMust include some cases from high-risk patients based on criteria established by laboratory directorCertain percentage of prospective should include random non-high-risk cases as wellResults of cases selected for rescreening must not be reported until rescreen is completedSlides processed by imaging instruments must be rescreened in their entiretyComparison between individual performance and overall laboratory performanceCytotechnologist-to-pathologist correlationScreening limitsCLIA '88 limit of maximum number of slides that can be

maximum workload set by CLIA '88Primary screening pathologists must also take GYN proficiency test in primary screener modeTurnaround TimeLaboratory needs to determine timeframes for reporting test results; no CLIA '88 mandateSuggested turnaround time for NGYN tests: 48 hoursTurnaround time for GYN tests: 48-72 hours (large commercial labs) to 6-8 workdays (hospital labs)If unable to report patient test results in established timeframe, laboratory must determine and address delayExamination of Unknown Slides (Peer Comparison Survey Programs)Interlaboratory comparison programs provide valuable educational opportunities for peer comparisons in both technical and diagnostic areasAlso allows benchmarking with peers within lab as well as nationallyPolicy should be in place on remedial action if significant variance if foundDiagnostic StatisticsEach laboratory should produce statistical summary of various aspects of diagnoses at regular intervals and develop thresholds for acceptable deviation from these staticsDiagnostic category (including unsatisfactory) by preparation typeSignificant GYN and NGYN cytologic/histologic discrepancies (as defined by laboratory

cavities contain minimal amount of fluid for lubrication of surfacesFluid is virtually acellular; contains rare mesothelial cellsVariety of conditions, including neoplastic and nonneoplastic, can result in accumulation of fluid or effusionReactive mesothelial hyperplasia often associated with infections, collagen vascular disease, drug reactions, pneumothorax, chest surgery, and traumaDepending on physical, chemical, and microscopic characteristics of fluid, effusions can be subdivided into transudates and exudatesDistinction is important because most malignant effusions are exudates; therefore, cytologic evaluation of transudates is not as criticalTransudates: Result of intravascular pressure alterationAttributable to heart failure, renal failure, or cirrhosis in most instancesClear fluids with low specific gravity (< 1.015), low protein content (< 3 g/dL), and low lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (< serum LDH)Have scant cellularityExudates: Result of mesothelium injuryMalignancy, infections, autoimmune disease, infarction, and trauma are major causesTurbid fluids with greater specific gravity (> 1.015), high protein content (> 3g/dL), and high LDH level (> serum LDH)Tend to have higher cellularity with numerous mesothelial cells, inflammatory cells, ± tumor cellsCollection and ProcessingBody FluidsCollected by aspiration of cavities or by pelvic washings at time of surgerySpecimens are sent unfixed in heparinized bottlesSpecimens are processed immediately or refrigerated at 4 °C until time of slide preparationSpecimens may be processed as direct smears, cytocentrifuge slides, thin-layer slides, or filter preparationPap and Diff-Quik stains are used for routine cytologyCell blocks can be prepared from fluidAbundant fluid received in most specimens facilitates successful cell blocksCell block sections are useful to evaluate architecture and to perform immunocytochemical/special stainsCell blocks may also be useful for molecular analysis, but often many benign cells are present, making analysis more difficult with false-negative results due to low percentage of malignant cellsFresh fluid can be submitted for flow cytometry, cytogenetics, or molecular analysisFlow cytometry is unlikely to detect clonal population in absence of morphologic abnormality, high clinical suspicion, or history of lymphomaPeritoneal washings are often collected during staging of gynecologic or other nongynecologic peritoneal malignancies or to rule out malignancyPeritoneal washings strip mesothelial surface, resulting in large sheets of cells that can be foldedCollagen balls, histocytes, and lymphocytes often presentBecause these specimens are collected as part of surgical staging, correlation with concurrent surgical specimen is recommendedRare benign or malignant endometrial cells can appear in these specimens due to artifactual intraoperative expulsion of cells via fallopian tubesNormal Cellular ComponentsBenign EffusionsContain variable numbers of mesothelial cells, histiocytes, lymphocytes, and red blood cellsMesothelial cells shed as single cells, sheets, or small clusters with scalloped periphery (< 10-15 cells per group)Reactive mesothelial hyperplasia can result in cellular sample with numerous single cells, papillary fragments, or 3D clustersPsammoma bodies can be presentCytomorphology of Mesothelial CellsCuboidal to round cells with variable cell and nuclear sizeAbundant foamy, vacuolated, or dense cytoplasm with 2-tone appearancePeripheral clear outer rim (\"lacy skirt\") is result of long, slender microvilliEmpty spaces between cells (\"windows\") also result from microvilliOccasionally, cell-within-cell arrangement (\"hugging\") may be seenIntracytoplasmic fluid-filled vacuoles that peripherally displace nucleus occur in small percentage of cellsBinucleation or multinucleation are commonOccasional multinucleated giant mesothelial cells can be seen in reactive conditionsNuclei are round to oval with fine chromatin and 1 or 2 nucleoliNuclear membrane is smoothOccasional mitosis can be seenCharacteristics of Reactive Mesothelial CellsHighly cellular specimens with spectrum of normal to atypical cells3D clusters, acinar groups, papillary fragments, and cell balls with cytologic features similar to background mesothelial cellsVariation in nuclear size with increased nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio, irregular chromatin distribution, irregular nuclear contours, prominent nucleoliMarked atypia of mesothelial cells can be seen in patients with uremia, dialysis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, and history of radiation/chemotherapyIt is important to take clinical history into consideration to avoid false-positive diagnosisCytomorphology of Other Normal Cellular ComponentsCytomorphology of histiocytesNumerous histiocytes can be present in cases of cancer, tuberculosis, rheumatoid effusions, and embolismHistiocytes do not form tight clusters, and no windows are seen between cellsNucleus is folded or bean-shaped with granular chromatinCytoplasm can be foamy, granular, or vacuolatedHistiocytes demonstrate positive uniform staining of cytoplasm with CD68 and are negative for keratin stainsCytomorphology of lymphocytesLymphocytic-rich effusions can be seen in cases of cancer, tuberculosis, and status post coronary artery bypassReactive T lymphocytes will be seen in any chronic effusionT lymphocytes are small, often with irregular nuclear contoursDifferential DiagnosisDifferential Diagnosis of Reactive Mesothelial CellsMetastatic malignancyHas 2nd population of malignant cells2nd population of malignant cells may not be obvious in some cases that shed as single cells, such as lobular carcinomas, melanomas, sarcomas, and lymphomasClusters of mesothelial cells have scalloped border, whereas clusters of metastatic carcinoma cells have smooth cell borderReactive mesothelial cells have spectrum of changes from normal to atypical cells that retain some characteristics of mesothelial cellsCorrelation with clinical/radiologic findings and immunocytochemical stains are often requiredInternational Mesothelioma Interest Group recommend ≥ 2 mesothelial (e.g., calretinin, D2-40) and ≥ 2 carcinoma markers (e.g., MOC-31, BER-EP4, claudin-4)MesotheliomaCellularity tends to decrease with repeated taps in reactive mesothelial proliferationsMalignant mesothelioma effusions are usually very cellular, and high cellularity persists with repeated taps unless therapy has been initiatedMesothelioma should be considered in cases with large clusters (> 15 cells per group) &/or marked cytologic atypiaIt is necessary to correlate with clinical/radiologic findings (and surgical specimens when available) to avoid false-positive diagnosisDemonstration of invasion of pleural tissue is diagnostic of mesotheliomaHowever, reactive mesothelial proliferations are often entrapped by fibrin, fibrosis, and granulation tissue that may mimic invasionDifferential Diagnosis of Lymphocyte-Rich EffusionLymphomaPresence of numerous lymphocytes may raise concern for lymphoma, but, if all cells are small, lymphoma is unlikely in absence of clinical historyFlow cytometry is highly effective for ruling out lymphoma but should be used sparingly due to high cost and low yieldTuberculosisCommon cause of effusions in developing countriesImmune-related conditionsCollagen vascular diseases or response to malignancy can result in numerous lymphocytes in fluidsInternational System for Serous Fluid CytopathologyPurpose and OriginStandardized diagnostic and reporting system produced by international collaborative effort in 2020Scant supporting studies at present; intended as baseline model to facilitate studies of its

may be NDMinimum volume threshold is 50-75 mLNegative for malignancy (NFM)Only benign cells presentAtypia of undetermined significance (AUS)Small numbers of cells with features making it difficult to exclude malignancyShould be used sparingly in cases felt to be probably benign (ideally should have ~ 20% risk of malignancy)Suspicious for malignancy (SFM)Likely malignant, but evidence falls short of confirmation (should have ~ 80% risk of malignancy)Ancillary testing (immunochemistry, flow cytometry, genetic studies) can often be used to avoid this categoryMalignant-primary (MAL-P)For

avoid fan-like motion in thyroidUse tactile sensation to confirm needle is in lesionIf large amount of fresh blood is observed in needle hub, discontinue procedure immediatelyMotion > 10 seconds increases likelihood of excessive clottingRelease trigger, remove needle, and apply sterile pressure over area for ~ 1 minute or until cessation of bleedingUse of low-dose anticoagulants does not preclude aspiration (adjust procedure by decreasing length of time under skin and applying pressure after procedure for greater duration)Use ice pack with firm pressure between passes if needed to control bleedingKeep ice pack at site post procedure for ~ 2 hours if patient is on anticoagulants and bleeds easily during procedureExpress aspirated material using plunger onto slide labeled with ≥ 2 patient identifiers and carefully smear material across slideOne slide is air dried and stained using Diff-Quik methodologyCorresponding opposite slide is alcohol fixed for Pap or rapid Pap methodologyRapidity in this step is essential to eliminate as much air-drying artifact (on Pap slide) and clotting as possibleAspirating small amount of air into syringe before procedure obviates alternative of (after having performed procedure) removing needle, pulling air into syringe, and then reapplying needle to express material onto slide (1st is faster and safer)Gently (gravity assisted) place one slide on top of another, and move each in opposite directions to smear material across 2 slidesAny increased pressure may cause rupture of delicate cellsIn cases of abundant aspirated material, such as cyst, place needle onto slide and allow only 1 or 2 drops onto slideRinse remainder of aspirate in various collection mediaRPMI for flow cytometry or cell block (fluid should be turbid)CytoLyt or formalin for cell blockCulture bottles for microbiologic studiesAdditional passes as needed to complete procedure based on adequacy assessmentUsually 3-4 passes are requiredFrench Technique (Capillary Action, No Aspiration)Useful when operator needs better/finer control of needle in tight spaces where addition of syringe is too cumbersome or in cellular lesionsConnect needle to syringe and remove plunger before aspirationHold syringe hub with attached needle between finger and thumbHolding needle itself is not entirely safe, hence syringeBasic FNA technique is followed except that needle is used in cutting motion onlyNo supplemental suction (negative pressure) is applied during procedureMaterial is expressed onto slides as above by inserting plunger post procedureButterfly TechniqueUseful in areas, such as oral cavity, without enough space to optimally move needle with attached syringeMain drawback of this technique is that it requires 2 operators: One to move butterfly needle back and forth and another to provide suctionAbdominal Fat Pad AspirationUse larger needle between 18-21 gaugesMore aggressive sampling using aspiration gun until drop of fat is visible in syringeConsider using combination of frosted or charged slides for smearsNo need for ROSEMake extra passes for cell block only and collect material in RPMI or formalin or fixative of choiceRemind prep tech making cell block that fat floats; hence, skim fat at top and add to cell block buttonCut cell block slides at 7-10 μm for Congo red stainsIf positive, speciation of amyloid is key for management purposesComplicationsAll Are Uncommonly EncounteredHematomasMinimize with immediate cessation of procedure once fresh blood is visualized in needle hubApply ice pack and pressureDizziness/faintingUse Trendelenburg positionPneumothoraxPossible in chest wall, axillary, supraclavicular locationsAvoid deep penetration as much as possibleNeedle tract seeding/tissue alterationsRare with small-gauge needles and experienced operators",

hence, in absence of other features of PTC, best to interpret as AUS/FLUSAtypical cells of uncertain origin, raising possibility of other epithelial or mesenchymal processes but without availability of history or ancillary diagnostic studiesOther instances of atypia not described aboveRemember, AUS/FLUS is diagnosis of last resortAtypical or Monotonous Lymphoid InfiltrateCould be in background of Hashimoto and would require immunophenotyping by flow cytometry for definitive diagnosisIn absence of sufficient changes for diagnosis of \"suspicious for lymphoma,\" these could be classified as \"atypical lymphoid cells\" with repeat aspirate for flow cytometryPreparation Artifact NotesBy themselves, preparation artifacts and hypocellularity do not warrant AUS/FLUS diagnosis, provided there is no atypia and changes are only focal in otherwise obviously benign caseHowever, there are scenarios where AUS/FLUS diagnosis can be made (after acknowledging compromised nature of specimen)Air-drying artifact that hinders adequate evaluation of cellular and nuclear atypiaClotting artifact resulting in apparent cellular crowdingExcessive blood, obscuring cells and architectural evaluationExcessive ultrasound gel, obscuring architectural or nuclear evaluation, is best interpreted as nondiagnostic unless worrisome atypiaReporting CriteriaReporting RatesAt time of 2007 Bethesda conference, reporting rates for AUS/FLUS were expected to be between 2-7%Unfortunately, indiscriminate use of this AUS/FLUS category has resulted in rates as high as 22%Maximum reporting rate of 10% is more realistic benchmarkMalignant outcomes at time of meeting were expected to be between 5-15%Actual outcomes have varied widely2017 version of Bethesda has revised risk of malignancy (ROM) based on data published since 2007 as well as considering newer indolent entity of NIFTP, which cannot be diagnosed cytologicallySome NIFTP cases will be diagnosed in AUS/FLUS category pushing down ROMReporting NotesInterpretation of AUS/FLUS implies that specimen is adequateNarrative comments as to cytologic vs. architectural atypia are encouragedAvoid using phases associated with malignancy (nuclear pseudoinclusions, rule out papillary carcinoma) that may prompt surgeryManagement of AUS/FLUSRepeat FNA under ultrasound guidanceManage based on repeat diagnosis~ 10-30% of repeat FNAs result in AUS/FLUS diagnosisIf repeat AUS or worse, consider lobectomyROM in AUS/FLUS category varies with type of atypiaAUS due to cytologic atypia has mean ROM of 47%AUS/FLUS due to Hürthle cell/oncocytic atypia has ROM of 5%Reflex molecular testing per guidelines (preferred approach)Molecular-derived ROM calculation may be better option for clinical decision making and comparisonFor management decision, combination of cytologic, molecular, sonographic, clinical, and patient preference should be taken into considerationNotes on Molecular TestingReflex molecular testing from residual in CytoLyt vial or collecting in specialized media for commercially available molecular testing at time of FNA (1st time or repeat) is preferred optionDifferent testing algorithms are available commercially for triage or can be laboratory-developed test with appropriate validation\"Rule out\" test like Afirma gene expression classifier (GEC) is best suited when prevalence of malignancy is low; newer gene sequencing classifier (GSC) is also rule in testBenign/negative result on GEC results in ROM dropping from 24% to 5%, thus justifying observation over surgery~ 50% of GEC tests in AUS/FLUS are negative/benignGSC has higher benign call rate and higher ROM for suspicious resultAUS/FLUS cases due to Hürthle/oncocytic changes tend to perform poorly with false suspicious results on GEC (only 15% ROM on subsequent resection)Addition of GSC by Afirma has resolved issue with oncocytic specimens\"Rule in\" tests like mutational testing (Thyroseq 3 or MiRinform) best suited when prevalence of malignancy is high in given category (like suspicious for malignancy or FN/SFN)Single test like BRAF V600E has low PPV in AUS/FLUS, which has low ROMExpanded mutation panel is more sensitive, but RAS mutations in these panels drop specificity (adenomas can show RAS mutations)50, 80, and higher gene chip testing for actionable mutations also available for use on next generation platforms and are replacing many older individual testsPerformance MeasuresAUS:malignant ratio can be calculated for lab as well as individual pathologistCan be used as performance measure and for benchmarkingBased on studies, higher AUS rate = lower rate of malignancy on follow-up, implying imprecision/overinterpretationRecommend ratio between 1 and 3If ratio is > 3, overuse of AUS;

F:M = 4:1; age 20-80 years, mean: 46 yearsCytologically, it is not possible to distinguish NIFTP from invasive FVPTC; distinction based on surgical resection and complete pathologic evaluationIn 2022 WHO classification, NIFTP is considered low-risk follicular cell-derived neoplasm with excellent prognosisHistologically, both are characterized by irregularly shaped, small- to medium-sized follicles with hypereosinophilic colloid on H&E stainNuclear overlap and crowding, powdery nuclear chromatin with nucleoliPapillae and psammoma bodies rare or absentIntranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions rare/not as abundant as classic or other subtypesInsular or trabecular pattern may be seen in invasive variant, which shows capsular or vascular invasion, necrosis and mitosis, and can metastasizeFVPTC is malignant neoplasm; 2 types: Infiltrative and encapsulated with capsular/vascular invasionCytologyCytologically cannot distinguish invasive FVPTC from NIFTPUsually cellular samples with microfollicles and syncytial-like fragments containing microfollicular patternBranching staghorn-shaped sheets of cells are helpful clues on low-power scanning, if presentColloid typically thick and within follicles or trailing folliclesPale nuclei with open, powdery chromatin with micronucleoli and nuclear groovesIntranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions are found in fewer cells compared to usual papillary carcinomaPsammoma bodies and papillary fibrovascular forms are rare or absentMultinucleated giant cells and cystic changes are uncommonCytologic diagnosis of \"malignant\" should not be made in absence of fibrovascular cores/papillary fronds, psammoma bodies, many intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusionsBest to designate such cases as \"suspicious for malignancy\" or in \"follicular neoplasm\" category; rarely in AUS if hypocellularMolecular testing helps with surgical planningManaged with hemithyroidectomy; further management based on findings in resected specimenBased on published literature, most are cytologically reported in follicular neoplasm (TBS IV), suspicious (TBS V) or AUS (TBS III) categoriesMolecular testingInfiltrative FVPTC: BRAF V600E, RET::PTC fusion, NTRK fusion, ALK fusionEncapsulated FVPTC: RAS mutations (like follicular carcinoma)NIFTP: RAS mutations, PAX8::PPARG fusion, BRAF K601E, EIF1AX, THADA fusionCystic SubtypeGeneral Features and Cytology~ 10% of PTC are cysticThin, watery, brown or clear cyst fluid on aspiration;

        "raw_text": "TERMINOLOGYUltrasound Principles and DefinitionsUltrasound (US) is primary imaging modality for assessing thyroid nodulesEchogenicity refers to brightness of tissuesHyperechoic: More echogenic (brighter) than surrounding structuresIsoechoic: Same echogenicity as surrounding structuresHypoechoic: Less echogenic (darker) than surrounding structuresAnechoic: No echoes within lesion (appears black)Anechoic structures are usually simple cystsPosterior shadowingCertain structures, such as large calcifications and gas, are very bright reflectors and do not allow sound beams to travel furtherTissues deep to these bright reflectors appear black or gray (shadowed)Enhanced through-transmissionWhen US beam travels through fluid (e.g., simple cyst), there is no tissue to reflect sound beam back, so it appears anechoic (black)Because sound beam is not attenuated as it travels through cyst, it is stronger when it hits tissues beyond cyst, making them appear brighter (enhanced through-transmission)Comet-tail artifactWhen US beam hits small crystalline structure, it may cause reverberationAppears as small, bright echo with progressively smaller echoes posteriorlyCreates inverted triangle or comet shapeColloid commonly creates comet-tail artifactsTransducer typesHigher frequency (7-15 MHz) linear transducers have better resolution but poorer penetrationUsed to evaluate superficial structuresIdeally suited for thyroid glandLower frequency (2-6 MHz) vector transducers have better penetration but poorer resolutionUsed to evaluate and biopsy deeper structures, such as liver and retroperitoneumAnatomyThyroid GlandH- or U-shaped gland in cervical neck, anterior and lateral to trachea with 2 lateral lobes connected by isthmusEach lobe measures ~ 4 cm in height, often asymmetric40% of people have pyramidal lobe ascending from isthmus area toward hyoid boneNeed to be aware of complex surrounding anatomy when planning biopsyPosteromedially are tracheoesophageal groovesContains esophagus, paratracheal lymph nodes, recurrent laryngeal nerve, parathyroid glandsPosterolaterally are carotid sheathsContains common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, vagus nerveAnterolaterally are sternocleidomastoid and infrahyoid strap musclesArterial supplySuperior thyroid arteries arise from 1st anterior branch of external carotid arteryInferior thyroid arteries arise from thyrocervical trunk, branch of subclavian arteryVenous plexus on surface of gland drains to left brachiocephalic and internal jugular veinsLymphatic drainage is extensive with initial drainage to periglandular nodesParatracheal nodes drain along recurrent laryngeal nerve into mediastinumUltrasoundNormal Thyroid GlandUS is modality of choice for evaluating thyroid glandHigh-frequency linear transducers give excellent anatomic detailThyroid parenchyma is homogeneous and mildly hyperechoic compared with adjacent musclesBoth longitudinal and transverse scans, including adjacent lymph nodes, are required for comprehensive evaluationDocument and characterize any lesions, specifically in relationship to trachea, major vessels in carotid sheath, and extrathyroidal extensionLook for breach in thyroid capsuleNodulesThyroid nodules are common and often incidentally found on physical exam or imaging procedures being done for other reasonsImportant to know which features are associated with carcinoma and therefore warrant biopsySuspicious sonographic features Solid nodules with lobular or irregular bordersNodule appears hypoechoic when compared with normal thyroidPresence of microcalcificationsPunctate, nonshadowing, echogenic fociNodule taller than wideAdenopathy: Suspicious lymph node has loss of normal, echogenic, fatty hilumSonographic features favoring benignancy Purely cystic noduleAppears anechoic with enhanced through-transmissionSpongiform appearance: Abundant colloid creates small cysts in lesion making it appear sponge-likeCalcifications with linear, comet-tail appearanceNodule is isoechoic or hyperechoic compared with normal thyroidBoth benign and malignant lesions may show increased vascular flow, so color Doppler is not good discriminator regarding need for biopsyBiopsyPatient SelectionGuidelines vary but all include decision algorithm using sonographic features and nodule size2 most commonly used guidelines are from American College of Radiology (ACR) and American Thyroid Association (ATA)ACR Thyroid Imaging, Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) committee formed to standardize lexicon and biopsy recommendations based on imaging appearanceNodules are scored on 5 categories: Composition, echogenicity, shape, margin, and echogenic fociPoints from each category are added together to determine classificationTI-RADS 1 (TR1): 0 points, benign; no FNATR2: 2 points, not suspicious; no FNATR3: 3 points, mildly suspiciousFNA if ≥ 2.5 cmFollow if ≥ 1.5 cmTR4: 4-6 points, moderately suspiciousFNA if ≥ 1.5 cmFollow if ≥ 1.0 cmTR5: ≥ 7 points, highly suspiciousFNA if ≥ 1.0 cmFollow if ≥ 0.5 cmGeneral ConsiderationsExplain procedure and obtain consentComplications are minimal and generally limited to hematomasMay either palpate nodule or use US guidanceUS guidance improves diagnostic yieldDirect visualization allows targeting of most suspicious areaParticularly helpful if nodule has both cystic and solid componentsUS guidance helps avoid important surrounding structures (e.g., carotid artery, recurrent laryngeal nerve)Always perform FNA with cytopathologist presentEnsures correct slide preparationFewer unsatisfactory biopsiesExamination by cytopathologist at time of biopsy allows determination of when adequate amount of tissue has been obtainedUltrasound-Guided FNAPlace patient supine with pillow under neckThis extends neck, making more room for transducerUse small footprint high-frequency transducer\"Hockey stick\" transducers are ideal for thyroidMark area for biopsySterilize skin with Betadine or other sterilizing agentSterile draping is not generally doneMay anesthetize skin with 1% lidocaineGive patient optionLidocaine burns and is often more uncomfortable than small needle used for biopsyAnesthetize only superficial structuresDo not infiltrate lidocaine into thyroid nodule as it may affect aspirateUse small (generally 25-gauge) FNA needlesBiopsy techniquesFrench techniqueNeedle only, without syringeHold needle near hub for better controlCapillary action only, no aspiration10-cc syringe without suctionSyringe is often easier to handle than needle aloneAttach syringe to needle and pull plunger back so there is 2-3 cc of air in syringeThis creates negative pressure in needle assisting in aspirationWith air already in syringe, it is easier to express aspirate onto slide10-cc syringe with suctionIf inadequate results with either of previous techniques, may use suction while performing biopsyUsually not necessaryMore likely to get blood in hub22-gauge core biopsy may be performed if FNA material is deemed inadequate for diagnosis by cytopathologistUse direct US guidance during biopsyTarget most suspicious area of nodule (e.g., microcalcifications)Hold needle and transducer in same plane visualizing entire shaft of needle while entering noduleOnce needle is appropriately placed, begin biopsy using short rapid cutting motion while continuing to directly observe under USContinue biopsying for ~ 10 secondsPass sample to cytopathologist for appropriate slide preparation3-4 passes are generally requiredMake sure entire lesion is sampledCytopathologist determines when adequate tissue has been obtained",

ideally, lesions recognized as precursors to cervical cancer; Pap test may also reveal endocervical &/or endometrial pathologyBackgroundScopePap test aims to collect epithelial cells from circumference of ectocervix and endocervical canal; cells may be mechanically dislodged by sampling devices or naturally exfoliating suspended in cervicovaginal fluidNegative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy implies no abnormal epithelial or nonepithelial cells identified; however, Pap test is associated with inherent false-negativity mainly due to possible sampling error &/or cytomorphologic complexity and overlapCell TypesType and maturity of epithelial cells identified in Pap tests depend upon sampling devices used and female'sAgeHormonal and menstrual statusExtent of ectopy (ectropion)Extent of transformation zoneLocation of squamocolumnar junctionsEpithelial integrity or traumaMost cervical squamous carcinomas arise from cervical transformation zone (squamocolumnar junctions)Sampling is confirmed by either endocervical cells or squamous metaplastic cellsEpithelial TypesStratified squamous epitheliumThickens and matures under influence of estrogen [peak levels at mid cycle (day 15)]Estrogen gradually diminishes after day 15 and progesterone predominates; both hormones diminish approaching end of cycleHealthy, mature cervicovaginal stratified squamous epithelium in females of reproductive age has 3 main zonesBasal zone (consisting of least mature, basal cells)Mid zone (consisting of parabasal cells and intermediate cells)Superficial zone (consisting of superficial cells)Due to lower estrogen levels during menopause, squamous epithelium is atrophic, maturing up to lower mid zone (i.e., predominantly parabasal cells)Progesterone permits squamous epithelial maturation to upper mid zone, thickening intermediate cell layersProliferation &/or maturation of cervicovaginal squamous epithelium may also occur secondary to chronic irritation, inflammation, or infection and may produce hyperkeratosis &/or parakeratosis regardless of patient ageSimple endocervical epitheliumLining glandular invaginations into underlying endocervical stromaAt birth, junctions of squamous and endocervical epithelia (i.e., squamocolumnar junctions) are located on ectocervixApproaching puberty, cervical elongation retracts squamocolumnar junctions inward into endocervical canalAt puberty, cervical enlargement extends squamocolumnar junctions outward onto ectocervical circumference; exposed area of thin, endocervical epithelium is termed ectopy (ectropion)During reproductive age, ectopic, endocervical epithelium is gradually and haphazardly replaced by patchy, de novo squamous metaplastic epitheliumCervical area formed between initial, neonatal (native), squamocolumnar junction at 1 end and new squamocolumnar junctions formed between endocervical columnar cells and maturing squamous metaplastic cell islands is termed transformation zoneTransformation zone area diminishes with age and its margins migrate inward toward endocervical canal mainly due to progressive squamous metaplasia and decreasing cervical size during menopauseReplacement of endocervical glandular epithelium in transformation zone by squamous epithelium occurs from 2 processesSquamous epithelialization (generation and lateral expansion of native squamous epithelium due to basal cell hyperplasia)Squamous metaplasia (de novo generation of squamous epithelial cells from undifferentiated, bipotential, endocervical reserve cell hyperplasia)Squamous metaplastic epitheliumCytomorphology depends on degree of maturity (squamoid differentiation)Squamous metaplastic epithelium develops, matures, becoming indistinguishable from native squamous epitheliumSquamous metaplasia is divided into 3 categoriesImmature squamous metaplasiaMature squamous metaplasiaFlorid squamous metaplasia (tissue repair)Endometrial epithelial cellsEndometrial cells may be identified in Pap test cytopreparations due to physiologic exfoliation (normally during first 1/2 of menstrual cycle)Diagnostic significance of endometrial cells in Pap tests depends upon age and hormonal/menstrual status of female patient and cytomorphologyPhysiology/HistologyCervixLined by 3 epithelial typesMature (native) nonkeratinizing, stratified squamous epitheliumSimple columnar mucus-producing epithelium (lining most of endocervical canal)New (de novo) squamous metaplastic epithelium (forming squamocolumnar junctions between glandular columnar cells and native squamous cells within transformation zone areas of cervix)CytopathologySquamous CellsBasal squamous cellsSmall, round squamous cellsInfrequently seen; typically in background of inflammationParabasal squamous cellsRound to oval cellsDistinct cell borders when seen singly, indistinct cell borders when seen in sheets particularly in atrophic female patients (syncytial morphology)With advanced epithelial atrophy, dryness, and inflammation, parabasal cells may show dense basophilic or orangeophilic cytoplasm with pyknotic nuclei in background of cellular debris, proteinaceous material, and inflammatory cells (atrophic vaginitis)Intermediate squamous cellsLarge, flat, polygonal cellsSeen singly or in sheets of variable sizesUnder influence of hormones and accumulating glycogen, cytoplasm may appear bulbous with folded edges (navicular cells)In luteal menstrual phase, Lactobacilli (normal flora) convert glycogen into lactic acid, lowering vaginal fluid pH and fragmenting intermediate-cell cytoplasm, leading to naked nuclei in background of cytoplasmic debris with bacterial rods (bacterial cytolysis)Superficial squamous cellsLarge, flat, polygonal cells (slightly larger than intermediate cells)Hyperkeratotic squamous cellsSimilar morphology to superficial squamous cellsNuclei absent, forming \"ghost\" nuclear zonesParakeratotic squamous cellsSimilar size to parabasal cellsPyknotic nucleiEndocervical CellsEndocervical reserve cellsSubcolumnar, undifferentiated, bipotential cellsSmall, fragile cells, frequently spindle-shapedUsually associated with endocervical cellsRarely noted in absence of reserve cell hyperplasiaEndocervical columnar cellsMucus-producing columnar cells, sharp cell bordersPalisading or honeycomb morphology depending on angle of viewWith secretory activity cytoplasm is abundant due to mucin accumulation compressing nucleus to basal endOccasional cells ciliated with luminal surface terminal bars and pink-red ciliaSquamous Metaplastic CellsImmature squamous metaplastic cellsArising from undifferentiated, subcolumnar, reserve cell hyperplasiaCells may be seen isolated (with well-defined cell borders) or in cohesive groups or sheets (with ill-defined cell borders)May have spider-like morphology as desmosomes get detached during samplingMature squamous metaplastic cellsArising from immature squamous metaplasiaCells may be seen isolated or in loosely cohesive groups or sheets (with well-defined cell borders)Frequently noted intracellular junctionsFlorid squamous metaplastic cells (tissue repair)Hyperplasia of mature squamous metaplastic cells with mitotic activitySignificance: Attempt to rapidly repair epithelial trauma secondary to surgery, cervicitis, infection, foreign bodies (e.g., IUD), or endocervical polypsEndometrial CellsEndometrial, glandular epithelial cellsExfoliated endometrial cells travel through endocervical canal and emerge at cervical os;

known types differentiated by L1 gene that encodes viral capsidE6 and E7 are other key genes that inhibit apoptosis to facilitate viral survival by blocking Rb, p53, and p21, leading to carcinogenesisLow-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) is human papillomavirus (HPV) viral cytopathic effect and corresponds to production of viral particlesHigh-risk HPV types can be incorporated into host genome and may result in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or carcinomaTestingResidual fluid from liquid-based Pap tests can be used for molecular testing to detect HPVSelf-collection kits for HPV screening without associated cytologyRecently FDA approved in USA (Cobas and Onclarity)Movement toward self-collection in many developed countriesRequires a means of triage for positive screens, either clinician-collected samples for cytology or reflex molecular testingMay be key to expanding cervical cancer screening to countries without well-established cytologic screening programsFDA approval is important for acceptance of molecular testing in USA, though in other countries less regulation is in placeTarget amplification methodsPCR (Cobas, Onclarity, and Alinity M)Segments of DNA are repeatedly copied and recopied by polymerase enzymes to produce large numbers of target genetic sequenceRequires temperature cycling to create new copies at lower temperature then release them for recopying at higher temperatureRNA can be detected by PCR if reverse transcription is used first to convert RNA into DNAFluorescent molecules can be used to monitor production of copies for quantitationNucleic acid sequence-based amplification (PreTect, HPV Proofer, and NucliSENS EasyQ)Uses reverse transcription to create DNA copy of target RNA followed by selective degradation of RNA and creation of double-stranded DNA from DNA copyDouble-stranded DNA is transcribed into numerous copies of RNA, each of which can then be converted to DNA and then to more RNA, resulting in amplificationHas advantage of being able to proceed at fixed temperature, unlike PCRTranscription-mediated amplification (TMA) (Aptima)Target RNA is captured by complementary oligomers attached to magnetic particleMagnetization of specimen captures RNA and allows for removal of extraneous nucleic acidsReverse transcription of magnet-captured RNA creates DNA that is copied and recopiedDNA copies bind to chemiluminescent probes and are detected by luminometerThese methods offer high sensitivityProduce many copies of target that can contaminate laboratory and lead to false-positive resultsNewer, highly automated versions require less technical skill and reduce contamination problemsFalse-positives still occur due to carry-over between vialsFalse-negative results are less rare than commonly assumed, due to causes includingInterfering substances (blood, lubricants, antifungal creams, etc.)Scant infected cellsLow copy numbers of HPV in cellsSignal amplification methodsHybrid capture technique (Hybrid Capture II)Target DNA attaches to HPV type-specific RNA probesAntibodies against DNA-RNA hybrids, attached to microplate wells, capture targets and allow for removal of extraneous DNAProbes directed against DNA-RNA hybrids with attached alkaline phosphatase enzymes then indicate presence of target by reacting with chemiluminescent substratesEach captured DNA results in release of many chemiluminescent signalsInvader technique (Cervista)Overlapping probes target HPV DNA, resulting in segment that cannot bind and is cleavedMany such cleaved segments result from binding to each targetEach of these segments can then combine with multiple fluorescence resonance energy transfer cassettes, resulting in fluorescent signalSignal amplification does not result in increased target nucleic acids, eliminating contamination problemDuring early years of HPV testing, Hybrid Capture technique offered combination of ease of use and FDA approval that led to its widespread adoptionHybrid Capture II has been replaced by newer technologies, but is still important as benchmarkHPV typingHigh-risk types for carcinogenesis: 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68Clinical HPV tests focus on detection of these typesSome tests examine L1 gene to maximize sensitivitySome tests target E6/E7 genes because they are more directly related to risk of malignant progression; therefore, higher specificityTypes 16 and 18 are especially common and virulent; triage tests for just these 2 types allow for more aggressive follow-upExtended genotyping gives type-specific information beyond types 16 and 18, allowing for differential triage of other high-risk typesHPV in situ hybridization staining directed at high-risk types is also availableLow-risk types that do not progress to cancer: 6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 70, 72, 81, and CP6108Testing for these types is discouraged but availableOther types have intermediate or unknown riskThese types are not detected by most tests but pose small risk of cancer progression DNA methylationMethylation analysis is promising triage method for use in conjunction with HPV

33, has been shown effective in various sites around the worldNegative methylation result could serve as rule out test for cervical carcinomaImmunocytochemistryDual stain of p16/Ki-67 is a commercially available, FDA-approved option for triage of high-risk HPV-positive screensRequires use of a proprietary staining platform utilizing ThinPrep slidesOne cell with both brown p16 staining of the cytoplasm/nucleus and red Ki-67 staining of the nucleus is sufficient for a positive resultMost studies show better sensitivity for high-grade lesions than Pap test cytologyp16/Ki-67, L1, and MMP-2/topoisomerase IIα have also been studied as triage tests for low-grade cytologic abnormalities on Pap testsIndicationsTriage for colposcopy after interpretation of atypical squamous cells of

results combined with negative cytology indicate very low risk of high-grade dysplasiaAllows for extended (3-5 year) screening intervals for double-negative womenLess common usesAs cotest with cytology after negative or low-grade follow-up colposcopy and biopsy following abnormal cytology, HPV-16 or 18 positivity, or persistent high-risk HPV positivityAs cotest with cytology after excision for high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma in situ as a test of cureNot recommended in young womenIf screening women below 25 years of age, cytology is preferred to HPV testingRationale for guidelines: HPV infection rates are high in young women, but high-grade lesions are infrequentPrimary high-risk HPV screening without cytology or with cytology triageMolecular testing is more readily automated and centralized than cytologyMany industrialized countries are adopting HPV-based screening strategiesHPV vaccination reduces prevalence of cervical cancer precursor lesions, making cytology screening less effectiveMolecular testing, with its increased sensitivity, can overcome this problemReduced prevalence of high-risk HPV in population also means fewer false-positives for molecular testingReferrals to colposcopy may still increase with this strategy, however, limiting its applicationCobas, Onclarity, and Alinity M have been FDA approved for primary screeningThis strategy has yet to achieve widespread acceptance in USAHowever, HPV primary screening every 5 years has been endorsed as preferred option by American Cancer Society for women ages 25-64HPV-based methods may allow screening to be extended into countries without established cytology workforceThese methods remain too expensive for most developing countriesFollow-UpHPV is not treated; only HPV-induced lesions areTherefore, knowledge of HPV status is useful only to assess riskTreatment algorithms are moving toward new paradigm of risk-based management2019 ASCCP management guidelines take into account past screening results as well as current resultsFollow-up decisions are based on immediate and 5-year risk of CIN3+CIN3+ includes cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3, adenocarcinoma in situ, and invasive carcinomaCIN3 was chosen as cutoff due to greater specificity for risk of invasive carcinoma than CIN grade 2 or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) as wholeDetermination of follow-up is responsibility of treating physician, requiring use of app or ASCCP websitePrior screening results unknown to cytology lab may impact follow-upAlgorithms are too complicated to memorize, unlike previous versionsASCCP intends to update app/website as new data and new technologies become available, altering algorithm incrementally without waiting to officially announce changes every few years4% risk of immediate CIN3+ is most significant risk level cutoff pointWomen with ≥ 4% risk go to colposcopy (or possibly expedited treatment if risk > 25%)4% cutoff approximates risk of single HPV-positive ASC-US screening resultIf immediate risk < 4%, follow-up screening is determined by 5-year risk of CIN 3+Return to screening may be in 1, 3, or 5 years depending on risk levelRescreening at 1 year is now recommended instead of colposcopy for many women with single positive screening result5-year intervals are recommended for women with negative HPV or cotesting and no prior positive

testing on same platformPlatforms include Aptima, Cobas, Onclarity, and Alinity MCulture is gold standard, but molecular methods are more sensitiveIndicationsIn USA, chlamydia screening is recommended for pregnant women, sexually active women ≤ 25 years of age, and women with new or multiple sex partnersCost effectiveness of widespread screening is not yet proven, and many countries only do opportunistic testingChlamydia and gonorrhea are often tested and treated togetherFollow-UpIn low-prevalence populations (older women, 1 partner), probability of false-positive molecular test may be higher than probability of true-positive results, necessitating confirmatory testingChlamydia is treated by single dose of azithromycin in most casesGonorrhea has extensive antibiotic

it successfully revealed timing of ovulation in this animal modelGrading Degrees of Cytomorphologic AlterationPapanicolaou's observations of cell types and their correlation with histology and physiologically relevant processes was published in American Journal of Anatomy (1917)Arguably, 1st literature describing detailed cytologic concepts and methodsPublication displayed photomicrographs, hence established morphology-based interpretive cytologyPapanicolaou introduced features of cell types, including descriptions of their overall morphologyNamely, cytoplasmic and nuclear detail, and how these were periodically altered by inflammatory cells and changing background milieu throughout guinea pig menstrual stagesBased on meticulous data collection, Papanicolaou introduced terms, initiating 1st cytologic vocabularyDescribed specific words and phrasesConsistency of vaginal fluid; pyknotic nuclei; weak affinity for plasma stains; degenerated; reticular structure; cornified; leukocytic digestion of nuclei; atypical desquamated cellsProposed likely significance of these entitiesTerm atypical implied detection of cells with morphology differing from that of other equivalent cell types, but beyond certain morphologic marginEssentially, cytomorphology surpassing that of arbitrarily defined thresholdsThese texts represented 1st likely attempt at grading degrees of cytomorphology, with descriptions of staining reactions relevant to gradingPapanicolaou was intrigued by subtle changes in cytomorphology as detected through H&E stainingBy 1917, he was able to identify various degrees of nuclear and protoplasmic degeneration through contrasting coloration in cornified and noncornified cellsHe was able to relate mosaics of cytomorphology with specific biological processesOf significance was Papanicolaou's ability to correlate his observations with histological and physiological processes in vaginal and uterine epitheliaThese realizations cemented concept of cytology as potential resource in clinical settingClinical ApplicationIn 1919, Papanicolaou directed his attention toward his wife, from whom he started collecting vaginal fluid samples daily (and subsequently for 21 years)Given her precise cycling, Papanicolaou established baseline, physiologically normal, gynecological cytomorphology and studied effects of aging upon human epithelial cellsFrom this long-term study, he perfected fixation and coloration of epithelial cells through Pap-staining methodIt was against her predictable cytomorphology that Papanicolaou subsequently learned to grade atypical cellsBetween 1920 and 1925, Papanicolaou exclusively studied samples collected from his wifeBeginning in February 1925, he analyzed samples collected from other female volunteers (from New York City Women's Hospital) to study hormonal cycling and vaginal cytologyThis work allowed him to study other cell-type combinations and inflammatory cell effects upon epithelial cells from females of variable ages and hormonal statusVariable hormonal status not previously encountered (i.e., pregnancy, post partum, abortion, menopause)Despite complexity of human vaginal cytology, he published successive reports describing ovarian hormone cytologyIn addition to analyzing samples from asymptomatic females, Papanicolaou included pathologic cases from whom he obtained preoperative vaginal fluid samplesIt was inevitable that he would eventually notice abnormal cells arising from cervical cancerCervical Cancer CellsNew cancer diagnosisIdentification of cancer cells intrigued Papanicolaou, yet it posed new challengesHe encountered cytomorphologic features differing substantially from those of normal cellsCancer cells exceeded cytomorphologic thresholds of normal cells he envisioned with unlike staining reactionsNevertheless, Papanicolaou learned to identify abnormal, exfoliated epithelial cells representing cervical cancer indirectlyBased on their unique features, he felt their detection was confidently indicative of malignancyHe published these conclusions in landmark report titled \"New Cancer Diagnosis\" in January 1928Papanicolaou expanded cytomorphologic vocabulary to emphasize differences between benign and malignant squamous cellsPapanicolaou introduced original conceptsEpithelial cytomorphology is related to variable bacterial flora seen in femalesBenign conditions such as myomas are impossible to diagnose by vaginal smear since all cells are normalMalignant cervical lesions yield cells showing cancerous modificationsThese include crowding of cells; large, disproportionate nuclei relative to protoplasm; very dark, dense, fragmented nucleiCancer cells are typically surrounded by robust leukomonocytic phagocytic reaction of organism itselfHis report received little notice and generated limited enthusiasm, all of which discouraged PapanicolaouVaginal smear was regarded as superfluous by leading pathologistsThus, for next 10 years, Papanicolaou studied primarily hormonal cytopathology with Dr. Ephraim ShorrHe described application of vaginal smear to identify human endocrinological imbalancesDiagnostic Value of Vaginal Smears in Carcinoma of UterusIn 1939, Dr. Stockard was succeeded by Dr. Joseph Hinsey, who was impressed by Papanicolaou's work on vaginal smear methodHinsey encouraged Papanicolaou to reevaluate efficacy of his method for detection of cervical cancerInvited Dr. Herbert F. Traut, Head of Gynecologic Oncology at Cornell, to collaborateTo generate needed material, they invited all female patients admitted for gynecological consultation at New York Hospital to receive cervicovaginal fluid samplingCollaboration between Papanicolaou and Traut produced seminal publications documenting effectiveness of vaginal smear method in detecting early cervical cancerHowever, it was generally felt that overall method needed additional evaluationTheir 1st report, \"The Diagnostic Value of Vaginal Smears in Carcinoma of the Uterus\" in 1941, attracted funding from Commonwealth Fund for ongoing trialsGifted artist, Hashime Murayama, helped illustrate their findingsPap Test PopularizationVarious studies were published, confirming that vaginal smear method was capable of detecting occult cervical cancers1st medical and scientific director of American Cancer Society, Dr. Charles S. Cameron, was instrumental for popularization of Pap testPap test received greater recognition and application following introduction of wooden spatula by Dr. J. Ernest AyreThis allowed direct sampling of cervical epithelia under visualization as opposed to collecting vaginal fluid containing randomly exfoliated epithelial cellsBy late 1950s, as recommended by American Cancer Society and demanding public and gynecologists, Pap test became recognized, standard health serviceResulted in systematic mass-screening practices to detect cervical disease precursor to cancerIn 1957, Papanicolaou (professor emeritus at time) retired from Cornell Medical College after 43 years of uninterrupted serviceHe maintained grueling pace of cytologic work and consultation until his death at age 78, on February 18, 1962, of myocardial infarctionOriginal Terminology of Pap-Staining MethodPapanicolaou StainPapanicolaou had encountered another impasse: Aqueous H&E staining posed significant limitationStaining of cells in cancer cases was too deep to permit sharp definition of their outlines in smears that were relatively thick or contained much bloodTerm deep implied opaqueness, hence problematic differentiation of subtle alterations in epithelial cells reflecting metabolic and physiologic changesPapanicolaou experimented with aqueous hematoxylin and alcoholic counter stainsHe then discovered that alcoholic fixation and counter staining resulted in nuclear and cytoplasmic transparencyMulticolor Pap-staining method was thus developed, providing superior delineation of cytomorphologyPapanicolaou and Traut published their findings in \"A New Procedure for Staining Vaginal Smears\" in 1942With this report, terms acidophilic and basophilic 1st appeared to reflect rainbow of hues apparent in cornified and noncornified squamous cellsCollaborators published refinements of Papanicolaou staining method in 1943In 1943, after analyzing thousands of cases, Papanicolaou and Traut published remarkable monograph, \"Diagnosis of Uterine Cancer by the Vaginal Smear\"Decisively changed course of eventsMr. Murayama's contribution was vital for establishment of Pap testArtistic and scientific nature of gynecologic cytopathology appeared in vivid color for 1st timeIntroduced were new cytologic terms and phrases accompanied by spectacular cytomorphologic images rendered in watercolor by Mr. MurayamaEmphasized concepts of atypical cells, grades, and differentiation of carcinoma, intradermal carcinoma, and early noninvasive (incipient) cervical carcinomaThese lesions could be discovered by vaginal smear method earlier than may be possible through biopsyJust after its release, distinguished Dr. James Ewing died of urinary bladder cancerThough he was skeptic of Papanicolaou's work, he endorsed method before his death, escalating overall energyFirst National Cytology ConferenceBoston (1948)Conclusions reached by Papanicolaou and Traut were reproduced by other investigatorsYet vaginal smear method remained unappealing to most pathologistsTherefore, in 1945, newly established American Cancer Society initiated campaign to educate profession regarding effectiveness of methodPapanicolaou felt that instruction should ensue from 1 sourceThus, he organized and taught 1st tutorial in exfoliative cytology in New York Cornell Medical Center in September 1947In response, American Cancer Society sponsored 1st National Cytology Conference in Boston in 1948Resolved that despite optional biopsy, vaginal smear method was sufficient to detect early uterine cancer before it was obvious and before emergence of cervical cancer symptomsPapanicolaou remained concerned over any widespread sampling in absence of greater interpretive knowledge and acceptance amongst practicing pathologists and cytologistsPap Class Reporting SystemIntroduced in 1948Smear technique coupled with Pap staining gained acceptance in realm of diagnostic nongynecologic cytopathology (i.e., urine, sputum, gastric, effusion, and breast)Though, emergence of particular false-negative and false-positive cases disturbed Papanicolaou immenselyIt occurred to him that method and its widening application required dedicated language by which to communicate both cytomorphology and ensuing diagnosisIn 1948, Papanicolaou introduced reporting system based on 5 arbitrary, ill-defined categories by which vaginal smears may be classified1st reporting system designed for gynecologic cytology, later named Papanicolaou Classification System (a.k.a. Pap Class System)Reporting categories communicated sense of confidence as to whether smears reflected malignancySuggested single, linear cascade of epithelial cell abnormalities arising from normal to cancerous epithelia5 classes (I, II, III, IV, and V) conveyed following findingsI: NormalII: InflammatoryIII: Suspicious of malignancyIV: Strongly suggestive of malignancyV: Definitely malignantAtlas of Exfoliative CytologyPublished in 1954Despite new reporting strategy, Papanicolaou realized yet another deficiency as reporting classifications lacked cytomorphologic reflectionTherefore, he and Hashime Murayama embarked upon fundamental work leading up to their magnum opus\"The Atlas of Exfoliative Cytology,\" published in 1954 by Commonwealth Fund, Harvard University PressRemains masterpiece composed of remarkable color plates of cells defining Pap classifications and their relevant cytomorphologic terms, mosaics, and marginsEmphasized ongoing refinement of Papanicolaou staining procedureDysplasia Reporting SystemFormalized in 1962Diagnostic data that emerged from cervical cancer screening programs suggested that precursor lesions differed from invasive cancerPrecursor lesions occur in younger femalesNot all precursor lesions progress to invasive cancerUntreated lesions do not necessarily advance to cancerSome precursor lesions regressPrecursor lesions demonstrate variable cytologic and histologic characteristics, hence gradesThese revelations came soon after Papanicolaou's deathDr. James Reagan formalized Dysplasia Reporting System in 1962His reporting system was designed upon premise that dysplasia is neoplastic, intraepithelial, cervical lesion (of various grades) of uncertain prognosis, in contrast with carcinoma in situ (CIS), which he regarded obligate precursor lesion to invasive cervical cancerIn contrast to Pap class system, Reagan's approach suggested distinct categories of intraepithelial lesionsAlthough dysplasia nomenclature became accepted by most pathologists, others objectedArgued that system could not adequately distinguish carcinoma in situ (CIS) from likely high-grade lesions with surface differentiationDysplasia nomenclature was associated with poor interobserver reproducibilityCervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Reporting SystemProposed in 1967It was also becoming evident that regardless of morphologic appearance, any precursor cervical lesion may potentially progress to invasive cancerBut frequency of likely progression may differ between low- and high-grade lesionsUnderstanding of cervical pathobiology prompted Dr. R. M. Richart to propose alternate approach in 1967Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) reporting systemNomenclature consisted initially of 3 CIN grades: CIN 1 (slight/mild dysplasia), CIN 2 (moderate dysplasia), and CIN 3 (severe dysplasia and CIS)Essentially, CIN 3 category reflected high-grade lesion with strong likelihood of progression to invasive cancerBy combining severe dysplasia with CIS, it simplified oftentimes difficult differentiation between these dysplastic cellsThe Bethesda System for ReportingNational Cancer Institute Conference (1988)Both dysplasia and CIN reporting systems reflected perception of cervical pathobiologic continuum through to invasive cervical cancerAll of these reporting systems featured ill-defined cytologic interpretive categories, yet discriminated koilocytotic atypia from true precursor dysplastic lesionsNevertheless, cervicovaginal smear method (i.e., conventional Pap test) was effective as screening tool despite its technical and reporting limitationsRecognition of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical carcinogenesis stimulated new insightsThere was also need for uniform reporting language linking cytologic interpretations and practitioner follow-upNational Cancer Institute convened conference in 1988 resulting in The Bethesda System (TBS) for reportingFeatured 2 groups of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions based on biologic behavior of HPV infection and specific subtypes involvedIntroduced bipartite concept of cervical precursor neoplasia: Low-grade and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL and HSIL, respectively)2 distinct biologic entities rather than initially perceived biologic continuumAlso intended to improve interobserver and intraobserver variability by reducing diagnostic categoriesLSIL reflected mild dysplasia and CIN 1; HSIL + moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, and CIS, i.e., CIN 2 and 3Introduced means to communicate atypical, inconclusive findings/diagnostic uncertainty1st reporting system to address phenomenon of cytomorphologic overlap possible between benign cellular changes and dysplastic cellular changesThis problem now reported through specific phrasingAtypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H)Atypical glandular cells (AGC)Also advocated definitions and diagnostic criteria of reporting categories and recommended follow-up and patient managementThe Bethesda System for Reporting Cervicovaginal Cytology (2001 and 2015 Versions, Which Are Nearly Same)Specimen adequacySatisfactory for evaluation (mention presence or absence of endocervical/transformation zone)Unsatisfactory for evaluation (specify reason)Specimen rejected/not processed (specify reason)Specimen processed and examined but unsatisfactory for evaluation of epithelial cell abnormality (specify reason)General categorization (optional)Negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM)Epithelial cell abnormalityOtherInterpretationNILMOrganismsTrichomonas vaginalisFungal organisms, morphologically consistent with Candida speciesShift in flora suggestive of bacterial vaginosisBacteria morphologically consistent with Actinomyces speciesCellular changes consistent with herpes simplex virusNonneoplastic findings (optional to report)Reactive cellular changes associated with inflammation (including typical repair)Radiation changes, follicular cervicitis, metaplasias, keratotic changesIntrauterine contraceptive device-related changesAtrophy and atrophic vaginitisGlandular cells status post hysterectomyEndometrial cells in females ≥ 45 yearsSpecify if negative for squamous intraepithelial lesion or malignancyEpithelial cell abnormalitiesSquamous cellAtypical squamous cellsOf undetermined significance (ASC-US)Cannot rule out high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H)LSIL encompassing HPV/mild dysplasia/CIN 1HSIL encompassing moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ;

requisition for ancillary test off cytology specimen (e.g., GMS, flow cytometry, FISH)Gross examination of color, turbidity, and volume of cytology specimen should be documentedSpecimen Preparation TechniquesCytocentrifugationAssessment of specimen: Macroscopic examination of specimen is used to select processing protocol (e.g., bloody, thick, watery, etc.)Initial centrifugation: 5 minutes at 2,200 RPM; pour off supernatantCritical resuspension of cell button: Depends on size of cell buttonResuspend in balanced electrolyte solution (RPMI) until slightly hazy suspensionLoading cytospin chambers: Sample chambers hold maximum of 0.5 mL (~ 20 drops) and ≥ 0.1 mL (~ 5-6 drops) should be usedLoad enough drops so cells will not dry out during spin; filter will absorb excess liquidGood cytospin preparation has monolayer of cells in tight cytospin circleCellular assessment slide: Diff-Quik stain can be done on cytospin to check thickness of preparationNumber of drops can be adjusted to increase or decrease cell distributionThinPrep nongynecologic processingInitial spin in CytoLyt: 5 minutes at 2,200 RPMEvaluate cell pellet appearance: If cell pellet is not free of blood, mucus, or protein, add 30 mL of CytoLyt and recentrifugeDetermine amount of specimen to be transferred to PreservCyt: If pellet is not visible, transfer entire sample into PreservCyt; if pellet is > 1 mL, transfer 1 drop of specimen into PreservCytSurePath nongynecologic processingTransfer 50-mL aliquot (or entire amount for small specimens) and centrifuge for 10 minutes at 600 g (program 3)Add 30 mL of BD CytoRich red preservative for all specimens except urine (add 30-mL SurePath preservative fluid for urine)Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 600 g, then decant supernatant and vortex tubesUse BD PrepStain instrument according to guidelinesThinPrep and SurePath gynecologic processingFollow exact manufacturer-recommended protocolStaining MethodsRegressive staining (Pap stain)Alcohol- or spray-fixed slides must be hydrated in preparation for aqueous hematoxylin stain (10 dips or 30 seconds)Nucleus is overstained in Harris hematoxylin for 2 minutes and then rinsed in running waterTo remove excess hematoxylin, slides are immersed in diluted HCl (1%) for 1-2 quick dips and then rinsed with waterMild hydrochloric acid dip causes lysis of red blood cells; this is advantageous for bloody FNA slides and other bloody prepsSlides are dehydrated in 95% alcohol to prepare for cytoplasmic staining2 minutes in OG stain and 5 minutes in mixture of EA 50/65 with alcohol rinses in betweenFinal dehydration in 100% alcoholClearing with xylene will prepare slides for mounting mediumProgressive staining (Pap)Alcohol- or spray-fixed slides must be hydrated with water in preparation for aqueous hematoxylin stain (10 dips or 30 seconds)Nucleus is stained in hematoxylin to desired intensity (~ 2 minutes) and rinsed with tap waterBluing agent is used to set nuclear dyeScott's tap water substitute or tap water can be used if pH > 8Follow steps for cytoplasmic staining, dehydration, and clearing with xyleneDiff-Quik stain: Rapid differential stain that gives results similar to those of Wright-Giemsa stain within secondsAllow slides to air dry completelyFollow with 10 dips in solution #1 (fixative), 10 dips in solution #2 (xanthene dye), and 10-20 dips in solution #3 (thiazine dye)Rinse in tap waterRapid Pap: Used in some laboratories for immediate evaluation and final diagnosisSlower than Diff-Quik but faster than complete PapTotal staining time: 90-130 secondsSeveral commercial kits are available with prepackaged solutions ready for useModified ultrafast Pap (MUFP) stain can be used with reagents and solutions common in cytopathology laboratorySuggested MUFP method; air-dried smears placed in normal saline for 30 secondsTap water (6 dips), Harris hematoxylin (30 seconds), tap water (6 dips), 95% isopropyl alcohol (6 dips), EA-36 (15 dips), 95% alcohol (6 dips), 100% isopropyl alcohol (6 dips), and xylene (10 slow dips)Destaining: Removes Pap stain from preparations to allow for restaining with same method or other stainsSoak slides in xylene until coverslip comes offPlace slide in xylene bath for 1-2 hours to remove residual mounting mediaDip slides in Pap staining set-up in reverse order, skipping actual stainsIf using regressive staining method, allow slides to sit in 1% hydrochloric acid until slide is destainingMicroscopically check progress of destainingRinse slides in running water for 5 minutes to remove acidCheck slide microscopically for decolorationDestain further if necessaryDehydrate by using 95% and 100% alcohol and clear in xylene before coverslippingCoverslippingManualClearing, which is final step in staining process, is also important prior to coverslippingClearing agent (typically xylene) should have refractive index of slide = 1.515Mounting media is substance that acts as permanent bond between glass slide and coverslipMounting media should have refractive index similar to those of clearing agent and glass slideCoverslip must cover entire cellular area24 x 55 mm is used for FNA slides, and 24 x 50 mm can be used for cytospin ThinPrep, SurePath, or preparations that cover ≤ 1/2 of slideNo.1 coverslip is recommended for cytologic useCoverslipping should be done in well-ventilated space, preferably under fume hood2 basic methods are used in coverslippingOne method is to place 1 drop of mounting media on coverslip and place slide at 45° angle to allow mounting media to flow up slide, thereby attaching coverslip to slideAnother method is to place 1 drop of mounting media on slide and drop coverslip on top of slide; care must be taken not to contaminate pipette used to drop media onto specimenAutomated Many automated coverslippers are available, belonging to 2 types: Ones that use glass coverslips and ones that use coverslipper filmGlass is preferred for cytologyAutomated coverslipper film is adhesive-backed film activated by xyleneFNAFNA procedures can be performed by trained cytopathologist, clinician, or radiologistSupplies needed to set up FNA clinic or traveling cartAlcohol preps, iodine swabs, sterile gauze, glass slides, sharps containers, cytology spray fixative, cytology/procedural forms, microscopeFNA guns (e.g., INRAD, Cameco, Aspir-gun, Tao Aspirator, etc.)Syringes (10 cc or 20 cc), sterile needles (20-25 gauge)Solutions for needle rinses (CytoLyt or RPMI)Type of stain for immediate adequacy (Diff-Quik or Rapid Pap)Gloves (sterile and boxed)Simultaneous use of both wet-fixed and air-dried smears is recommended2 slides complement each other and add to interpretation of caseMost common way to prepare smears used in cytologyPlace bevel of needle directly on glass slide near frosted end, then use 2nd or spreader slide to make smearsSpreader slide is gently lowered over droplet, which spreads out due to capillary actionSpreader slide is gently pulled straight back in 1 smooth motion down length of slideIf expressed material is scant, drop 2nd slide on top of specimen and pull up gentlyMaterial that remains in needle hub can be expressed in cytology preservative/solution (CytoLyt, RPMI, CytoRich Red, Saccomanno, etc.)Real-Time TelecytologyCan be time-efficient technique in busy cytopathology laboratoriesWith training and equipment, this technique can be made available at remote locationsDocumentation of training on equipment requiredFor CAP accreditation, items from telepathology section

initial centrifugation, centrifuge for 5 minutes at 2,200 RPMPour off supernatantTake wooden applicator stick and dip in cell button to obtain small amount of specimenSmear on glass slide and stain with Diff-QuikUse knowledge of what is on slide to help prepare specimenLarge-Volume Fluids (Vacutainer Bottles)Large-volume fluids present problem for laboratories that do not have enough room to store large Vacutainer bottlesAlternative is to store some of fluid in 100-cc specimen containers and use it for cell blocks, flow cytometry, or repeating specimenShake up bottle so cells become dispersed throughout fluidCells tend to settle to bottom of containerDraw out 50 mL in centrifuge tube to make original specimen, and place 100 mL in specimen container to use for further processing and studiesLarge bottle can be kept for few days or discarded after dividing specimen as describedBloody SpecimensAmmonium chloride lyse is recommended for cases in which flow cytometry may be orderedGrossly bloody specimens should be lysedLyse red blood cells by resuspending bloody cell button in ammonium chloride solution and allowing it to stand for 3-5 minutesCentrifuge suspension at 2,200 RPM for 5 minutesAmmonium chloride lyse 10x stock solution recipeWeigh out 41.3 g of ammonium chloride, 5.0 g of potassium bicarbonate, and 0.19 g of EDTADilute with 500 mL of deionized water and mix until completely dissolved (stable at 2-8 °C for 3 months)To make working solution, add 100 mL of stock solution to 900 mL of deionized water (stable at 2-8 °C for 3 months)Use of regressive staining method can also lyse slightly bloody specimensInstrumentationMost Common Instrumentation in Cytology LaboratoryBiologic safety cabinet: Class II-A2 is best suited and recommended for diagnostic cytology laboratoryClass I cabinet is similar to chemical fume hood and is usually hard ducted to exhaust system of buildingClass II cabinet can be used as specimen-processing stationAir is recirculated back into room through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters with little risk to outside environment if cabinet is maintained properly and certified annuallyClass II-A1 has positively pressurized contaminated air bordering air outside cabinet and is therefore less safe than class II-A2Class II-A2 has negative pressure surrounding positively pressurized contaminated air; negative pressure ensures that contaminated air will not be pulled out of cabinetClass III cabinet is designed for highly infectious agents that are not usually encountered in cytology specimensCentrifugesCentrifugation is used to separate cells from fluidCell fractionation studies have shown that cells sediment best at 600x gravity in 10 minutesThis depends on actual centrifuge used and on rotating radius of centrifugeMost commonly used centrifuge speed and time for cytology specimens are 1,200-1,500 RPM for 10 minutes or faster variation of 2,200 RPM for 5 minutesCytocentrifugesCytospin is special instrument designed to deposit cells on glass slide to be stained for cytologic examinationPrimary requirements are that specimen be cell suspension of single cells or cell groups and that cells are fresh and intactThin layer preparationsThinPrep: Can be used for gynecologic and nongynecologic specimens; sample preparation process involvesDispersion to separate debris and disperse mucusCell collection for which cells are collected on exterior surface of filter membrane by gentle vacuumCell transfer in which cells are collected on membrane of filter
