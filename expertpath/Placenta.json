vesselsThrombiHematoma (usually associated with disrupted vein during clamping of cord)Arc-like opacities of inflammatory debris oriented toward amnion surfaceDocument abnormalities with gross photographUmbilical Cord LengthReference values for cord length are established for fresh cord at gross examination> 70 cm at term considered excessively longFetal heart failure due to increased work of moving blood through long umbilical cordIncreased risk of cord wrapping around neck, body, or limbs with potential effects on circulation through affected body part as well as through cordAssociated with increased fetal activity, male sex, increased maternal height, BMI, and parity< 35 cm at term considered short (clinical correlation necessary)Associated with decreased fetal movementIncreased risk of premature placental separation or cord avulsionCord length shortens in fresh state ~ 3% in first 2 hours after deliveryFormalin fixation leads to further shortening of ~ 12% at 24-48 hoursLength of cord received in pathology is usually less than true total length, as segments may be sent from delivery room for blood gas analysis, cord blood banking, cytogenetics, or culturesUmbilical Cord DiameterReference values for cord diameter on fresh cordCord diameter measured from slides will be ~ 0.1-0.2 cm smaller due to shrinkage with fixation and processingThick cords (> 3 cm fresh) associated with large placenta, fetal macrosomia, and hydropsUsually due to increased volume of Wharton substance; may be secondary to increased umbilical vessel sizeThin cords (< 8 mm measured off slides) associated with prematurity, postmaturity, fetal growth restriction, maternal vascular malperfusion, and oligohydramniosThinning usually due to decreased volume of Wharton substance or single umbilical arteryUsually has wrinkled cord surfaceFetal end of cord is usually thicker than placental endUmbilical Cord CoilingHelical coiling of umbilical arteries around veinCoiling protects vessels from compression75% coil leftwardUltrasound cannot evaluate entire length of cord; correlation between coiling assessed by ultrasound and definitive assessment after delivery is poorAverage number of coils is reported as coiling indexNormal coiling ranges 1-3 twists per 10 cm of lengthCalculate by counting total number of 360° twists, divide by total length of cord, multiply by 10Hypercoiling and hypocoiling have clinical significanceCords shrink with formalin fixation; coiling index best calculated on fresh cordHypercoiled cords noted in 20%May be associated with increased vascular resistance to blood flow through cord with increased afterload on fetal heart, torsions, or strictures, further compromise flowChorionic plate and stem vessels may show thrombiHemodynamic effect of hypercoiling more severe in excessively long cordsMay have smooth, undulating, or linked appearance depending upon degree of narrowing with coilsHypercoiled cords with stricture is important cause of 2nd-trimester fetal growth restriction and demiseCan recur in subsequent pregnanciesHypocoiled cords noted in 7.5%May be more susceptible to kinking and acute obstruction of fetal blood flowAssociated with nonreassuring fetal heart rate and emergency C-sectionFlat cords may be associated with nuchal or body wrapsUmbilical Cord InsertionInsertion is defined as point where cord vessels branch and are no longer covered with Wharton substance\"Normal\" cord insertionInsertion within central 2/3 of disc (paracentral or eccentric insertion most common)Peripheral cord insertion, may be less efficientInsertion within 3 cm of disc edgeMarginal cord insertion, less efficientInsertion within 1 cm of disc edgeVelamentous cord insertion, less

surfaceNo protection by Wharton substance along branched segmentsIncreased risk of compression, thrombi, tearingGross ArtifactsTraction- or clamp-associated hematomasUsually due to clamping of cord with or without traction on clamp during delivery of placentaUsually disruption of thinner umbilical vein and extension of blood along perivascular spacesLook for parallel clamp marks on cord surfaceChanges should not be confused with hemorrhages that occur before delivery or true thrombi of cordPunctate hemorrhage may be due to cord blood sampling for gas analysisAvulsion of cord usually occurs with delivery of placenta after birthCommunicate with obstetric team if timing of avulsion is uncertainAvulsed cord typically has amnion attached at placental endThis is not equivalent to velamentous insertion of cordLook for vessels running through membranes to confirm velamentous insertionHistologic ComponentsAmniotic EpitheliumLow cuboidal epitheliumMay become squamous, especially near term and near placental insertion siteSkin-covered component at fetal abdomen will have dermal appendagesTightly adherent to underlying connective tissue, unlike amnion of membranesUmbilical

CytometryUseful to determine ploidyPHM are predominantly triploid, although aneuploid and tetraploid PHM have been identifiedTriploid conceptions may also be nonmolar (digynic triploidy)Genetic TestingShort tandem repeat (STR) genotyping is diagnostic gold standardDNA genotyping via PCR amplification of STR loci, identifies maternal and paternal genomic contributionsBest test for definitive diagnosis of early PHM, identifying diandric triploidyKaryotype or FISH will identify triploidyDoes not distinguish diandric (PHM) from digynic triploidy (nonmolar)Chromosome microarray may not identify triploidy with some methodologiesOnly testing that is single nucleotide polymorphism-based will reliably detect triploidyNoninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) that is single nucleotide polymorphism-based may be reported descriptively as possible triploid, vanishing twin, or unrecognized multiple gestation with suspected complete paternal uniparental disomy (UPD), most consistent with molar pregnancyNIPT commonly does not distinguish CHM with nonmolar twin from PHMAlgorithm for Use in Partial Hydatidiform Mole DiagnosisSubmitting remaining villous tissue (or 10 cassettes) from specimen often helps morphologic diagnosisAbnormal villous morphology changes characteristic of PHM often not fully developed in early PHMScoring system with major and minor features can help decide what cases should raise significant concern for PHM, warranting STR genotyping or follow-up hCGSTR genotyping to identify diandric triploidy used to confirm or exclude diagnosis of PHMAlternatively, general diagnosis can be made, such as \"abnormal villous morphology, cannot exclude PHM,\" and follow-up serum hCG is recommendedReasonable approach in resource-limited settingMay be clinically

Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale are uncommonSporozoite is transmitted by bite of infected female Anopheles mosquito or through infected blood productsSporozoite enters liver and replicates; rupture of hepatocytes releases merozoites that invade RBCsP. falciparum-infected RBCs accumulate in placenta due to adhesion to molecules, such as chondroitin sulfate A on syncytiotrophoblastsImmunity from prior infection produces blocking antibodies that prevent this bindingChondroitin sulfate A has is being examined as site for vaccine developmentP. vivax also has poor pregnancy outcome, which is more commonly seen in multigravidasMajority of malaria in USA originates elsewherePresentationParasitemia occurs 6-12 days after infectionPregnant women have 4-10x increased risk for infectionHighest risk during 1st pregnancy due to absence of chondroitin sulfate A antibodiesInfection during 1st pregnancy has 9% infant mortalityAccounts for 20% maternal mortality; usually due to severe anemiaIncrease in respiratory distress and cerebral malariaHighest risk for maternal infection occurs between 13-16 weeks with decreasing incidence after 24 weeks2-30% stillborn33% low birth weightCongenital malariaTransmission from placenta to fetus occurs in 15-40%Most are asymptomatic at birthDiagnosis usually made at 8 days of lifeFever most common symptomTreatmentPrevention and treatment during pregnancy to reduce maternal and fetal morbidityMost malaria are resistant to chloroquineResistance also developing to sulfadine-pyrimethaminePrimaquine is teratogenicMacroscopic FeaturesReduced weight of placentaHistologic FeaturesPlacental features: Histiocytic intervillositisAcute infection25% of placentas have trophozoite ring forms within maternal RBCs in intervillous spacePlacental sequestration results in much higher parasitemia in intervillous space than in peripheral blood, which makes diagnosis of maternal malaria difficultChronic infectionFew infected erythrocytes, mostly histiocytes containing hemozoin pigment in intervillous spaceHemozoin is birefringent and product of hemoglobin digestionSimilar in appearance to hematoidin and formalin pigmentPast infectionNo infected erythrocytes; hemozoin pigment in nodules of intervillous fibrin in intervillous space, which lasts for monthsP. falciparum: Heavy parasitemia, multiple parasites per RBCs; prominent chronic intervillositis; abundant, brown to black hemozoin pigmentP. vivax: Rarely has parasitemia, fewer intervillous mononuclear cells, and less yellow to brown hemozoin pigmentNonspecific changes include increased syncytial knots, injury of syncytiotrophoblast, thickened trophoblast basement membrane, and villous necrosisAncillary TestsOrganisms are usually visible on routine H&E stains; special stains (Giemsa, Thomas) are useful with low parasitemiaDifferential DiagnosisToxoplasmosis vs. Chagas vs. LeishmaniasisToxoplasma trophozoites distinguished from Chagas amastigotes by dark-staining kinetoplast in latterLeishmania concentrates in macrophages in skin, mouth, nose, or lymphoid organs, has smaller kinetoplast;

        "raw_text": "OVERVIEWIncidental Pathology of Fallopian TubeOpportunistic salpingectomy has led to submission of whole fallopian tube (FT) with fimbriae, often with placenta at deliveryUse of sectioning and extensively examining fimbria (SEE-FIM) protocol leads to increased detection of incidental metaplasias, heterotopias, cysts, etc., many of which were once considered rare and remain unfamiliarIncidental intraepithelial carcinoma is rare in this settingTERMINOLOGYDefinitionsOpportunistic salpingectomyRemoval of FT instead of tubal ligation while leaving ovaries intactRemoves tissue of origin for high-grade serous carcinoma as primary prevention strategyRapidly replacing tubal ligation as means of permanent contraceptionCommonly performed at cesarean section in women desiring permanent contraceptionShould be grossed with modified SEE-FIM protocol, but chances of finding intraepithelial carcinoma much lower than prophylactic salpingectomy in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriersStructure and Function of Fallopian TubeGross Anatomy of Fallopian Tube~ 10-14 cm longIsthmus: Proximal constricted portionMinute opening into uterus, ≤ 1 mmAmpulla: Middle dilated portion that curves over ovary, usual site of fertilizationInfundibulum: Outer portion surrounded by fimbria≤ 2 mm opening (ostium abdominale)Mesosalpinx: Fold of peritoneum that covers both FT, connects to mesovarium and broad ligamentNormal Histology of Fallopian TubeLined by columnar epithelium in longitudinal foldsCiliated cells, higher concentration toward fimbriaSecretory cells, higher concentration toward uterusOvoid dense nuclei, may have apical vacuoleIntercalated cells (reserve cell)Thin, dense nucleus with scant cytoplasmMuscular layers (outer longitudinal, inner circular),

ovarian/endometrial/colon cancer, young age at onset and multiple cancers in same person, male breast cancer, and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestryOpportunistic salpingectomy specimen should be evaluated with modified SEE-FIM approach, including embedding entire fimbriaeIf areas histologically suspicious for STIC are identified, immunostaining for p53, Ki-67, and submission of rest of FT for evaluation is

triploid, although aneuploid and tetraploid PHM have been identifiedTriploid conceptions may also be nonmolar (digynic triploidy)Genetic TestingShort tandem repeat (STR) genotyping is diagnostic gold standardDNA genotyping via PCR amplification of STR loci, identifies maternal and paternal genomic contributionsBest test for definitive diagnosis of early PHM, identifying diandric triploidyKaryotype or FISH will identify triploidyDoes not distinguish diandric (PHM) from digynic triploidy (nonmolar)Chromosome microarray may not identify triploidy with some methodologiesOnly testing that is single nucleotide polymorphism-based will reliably detect triploidyNoninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) that is single nucleotide polymorphism-based may be reported descriptively as possible triploid, vanishing twin, or unrecognized multiple gestation with suspected complete paternal uniparental disomy (UPD), most consistent with molar pregnancyNIPT commonly does not distinguish CHM with nonmolar twin from PHMAlgorithm for Use in Partial Hydatidiform Mole DiagnosisSubmitting remaining villous tissue (or 10 cassettes) from specimen often helps morphologic diagnosisAbnormal villous morphology changes characteristic of PHM often not fully developed in early PHMScoring system with major and minor features can help decide what cases should raise significant concern for PHM, warranting STR genotyping or follow-up hCGSTR genotyping to identify diandric triploidy used to confirm or exclude diagnosis of PHMAlternatively, general diagnosis can be made, such as \"abnormal villous morphology, cannot exclude PHM,\" and follow-up serum hCG is recommendedReasonable approach in resource-limited settingMay be clinically unacceptable when mother is having difficulty getting pregnant and does not want to delay getting pregnant againDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSISEarly Complete Hydatidiform MoleEarly CHM is easier histologic diagnosis in 1st trimester than EPHMNo direct evidence of embryo/fetus (except

retention in stroma &/or cytotrophoblast in nonmolar villiImplantation site may have atypical extravillous trophoblast proliferation of complete moleSTR genotyping confirms androgenetic component (difficult genetic diagnosis, may need expert)Must be followed as diagnosis of GTD (CHM)Biparental Familial Complete Hydatidiform MoleOften has history of recurrent pregnancy loss &/or molar pregnancyMay resemble PHM histology more than diffuse villous changes of CHMFortunately, p57 immunohistochemical expression is lost in villous cytotrophoblast and stromal cells, as in androgenetic complete moleAbnormal Villous Morphology (Nonmolar)Shares some features with PHM, at least focally: Irregular contours, villous enlargement, inclusions, trophoblastic proliferation, but not in sufficient quantity or extent to make histologic diagnosis of PHMDoes not have diandric triploidy by STRUsually small amount of villous tissue compared to PHMNormal implantation siteTrisomy 16 is most
