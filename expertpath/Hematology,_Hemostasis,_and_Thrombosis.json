and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP)Peripheral blood smear shows marked anisopoikilocytosis with RBC fragments, microspherocytes, and poikilocytesSimilar changes in patients are also seen secondary to severe thermal injury/burns﻿HPP﻿Recessively inherited form of HEIndividuals are double heterozygous for mutations in spectrin with RBCs that have ﻿both mutant α-spectrin (disrupts heterodimer self-association) and partial deficiency of normal spectrinHPP often presents with neonatal jaundice and hemolytic anemia that continues throughout lifeComplications of hemolysis are often seen, including splenomegaly &/or pigment gallstonesLaboratory diagnosisPatients with only elliptocytosis on peripheral blood smear tend to have mild or no hemolysisPoikilocytosis usually found in individuals with hemolytic forms of common HEHomozygous forms of HE also show cell fragments on peripheral blood smearAppearance of RBC fragments along with severe microspherocytosis, and only

mild alteration in RBC morphologyMolecular basis is unknownSoutheast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO)Highly prevalent in malaria-endemic areas of Southeast Asia and PacificPeripheral blood smear shows rigid, spoon-shaped cells that have longitudinal slit or transverse ridge (≥ 30% of ovalocytes)No clinical or laboratory evidence of hemolysisDecreased osmotic fragilityIncreased RBC rigidityReduced

inheritanceAdditional tests for diagnostic confirmation and differentiation of HE subtypesAlthough HE is predominantly morphologic diagnosis, additional testing may be needed when morphology does not provide clear diagnosis or management may be based on HE subtype or its distinction from other inherited RBC disordersEMA binding and ektacytometryOsmotic gradient ektacytometry (OGE) measures deformability and hydration of RBC population and helps in distinguishing HE from HS and hereditary xerocytosisGenetic testingMaybe helpful in selected cases for family testing, genetic counseling, or prenatal diagnosisPCR for known variants such as SAO band 3 deletion or low-expression α-spectrin allele [α-spectrin low-expression allele Lyon (LELY)]Next-generation sequencing, exome sequencing, and whole-genome sequencingAnalysis of RBC proteinsUsually limited to specialized laboratoriesSodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) can show deficient, abnormally truncated,

syndrome, Diphyllobothrium latum parasitic infection, disorders of ileal mucosa, and metabolic disordersPoor diet can be cause, but it is rare in developed countries unless extreme veganism is practicedPernicious anemia can lead to vitamin B12 deficiencyCaused by failure of gastric mucosa to secrete intrinsic factor, which is necessary for absorption of cobalaminBody is extremely efficient in absorbing, storing, and recycling B12, so that it may take 3-4 years of malabsorption before deficiency developsFolate found in dietary sources is ~ 50% bioavailable, and is highly susceptible to

platelets and calcium in whole-blood sampleCan vary from patient to patientACT is most reliable when heparin is only variableIt is less reliable when there are underlying reasons for abnormal hemostasisCoagulation factor deficienciesLupus anticoagulantsThrombocytopeniaAprotinin can prolong ACT when Celite activator is usedHypothermia and hemodilution can prolong ACTAnti-Xa AssayAnti-Xa assay for UFH and LMWH is used in specific situations when aPTT and ACT are inaccurate or when tighter control is requiredPresence of lupus anticoagulantRenal failureExtremes of weight and ageAnti-Xa assay is measured in U/mL of Xa inhibitionTest is performed on patient platelet-poor plasmaExcess antithrombin and factor Xa are added to patient sampleHeparin in sample binds to antithrombin and inactivates factor Xa added to sampleFactor Xa that is not inhibited by heparin:antithrombin is available to cleave chromogenic signal on substrateSubstrate is designed to mimic factor Xa cleavage site on prothrombinChromogenic signal is measured by spectrophotometry at specific wavelengthHeparin activity is inversely proportional to signal detectedHigh heparin activity → lower residual factor Xa → less chromogenic substrate cleavage → lower signalLipemia, hemolysis, and elevated total protein (e.g. in multiple myeloma) can interfere with this spectrophotometric assayCalibrators are available for UFH and LMWHTherapeutic ranges depend on type of heparin, indication, and periodicity of dosing (continuous infusion, once daily, twice daily)"

thromboplastin time (PTT)Activated clotting time (ACT)Platelet-poor plasma (PPP)LABORATORY METHODSActivated Partial Thromboplastin TimeUsed to monitor heparin therapy and to adjust heparin dose to maintain therapeutic levelPerformed on PPP prepared from 3.2% sodium citrate anticoagulated whole blood1:9 anticoagulant:whole blood ratioPPP is incubated in tube of cuvette at 37°CPartial thromboplastin reagent and calcium are added to sample and time to clot formation is measuredClot formation detected by mechanical, electrical impedance, spectrophotometric, or visual methodHeparin therapeutic range is determined for each laboratory's own PTT testing systemActivated Clotting TimeWhole blood assay that uses activator (e.g., kaolin) to initiate clot formationUsed to monitor heparin when high doses are usedSuch as for mechanical circulatory supportMeasured in secondsCan be measured in operating room or at patient's bedsideACT and aPTT are not interchangeableAnti-Xa ActivityAnti-Xa activity can be used to monitor UFH or LMWH therapyUFH heparin anti-Xa activity is measured in PPPPPP contains antithrombin:heparin complexes that depend on heparin content of PPPAntithrombin:heparin complexes inhibit standard amount of factor Xa added to sampleSome factor Xa not inhibited by AT:heparin complexes → Xa(free)Substrate with reporting structure is addedReporting structure emits fluorescence based on enzymatic activity of Xa(free)Signal is inversely proportional to heparin activityMore heparin → greater AT:heparin complexes → more inhibition of
