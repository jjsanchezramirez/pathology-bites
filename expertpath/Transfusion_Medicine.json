more often associated with other allelesHLA typing allows for matching of appropriate stem cell donor and recipient pairsCLINICAL APPLICATIONSHLA AntigensHLA antigens: Glycoproteins on body's cell surfaces involved in initiation of immune responsesPresent on surface of B lymphocytes, activated T cells, macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, platelets, and nucleated cellsConsist of 2 classesHLA I: HLA-A, B, CHLA II: HLA-DR, DQ, DPContribute to followingRecognition of self and nonself antigensDirectly involved in immune response to antigenic stimuliDirectly involved in coordination of both cellular and humoral immunityHLA system presents antigen on class I and class II HLA antigensClass I HLA antigens present antigens on surface of all nucleated cells in body (platelets typically have HLA-A and -B but can also have -C)Mature RBCs may express residual HLA class I antigens on their surface (Bennett-Goodspeed antigens, Bg)Purpose is to express different intracellular proteins (endogenous proteins) on cell surface for immune surveillanceIf cell expresses abnormal proteins, such as foreign antigens from viruses, or abnormal proteins due to neoplastic change, then immune system can target cell for removalCD8 T lymphocytes typically are immune cell that signals infected or malignant cell to undergo cell deathCritical to cellular immunity and may influence humoral immunityClass II HLA antigens are used by immune cells that are antigen presenting cells (APCs) to signal immune system to potential threatsPurpose is to express nonself proteins (exogenous proteins) obtained through endocytosis or phagocytosis by APCAPCs present these on their cell surface to interact with CD4 T lymphocytes to help coordinate immune system against nonself

resistance to recombination~ 25% chance of siblings being HLA identicalChance of finding matched sibling increases with number of siblingsEquation for probability of having matched siblingProbability of having matched sibling = 1 - (0.75^N) where N = number of siblingsIf only 1 sibling, probability is 25%If 2 siblings, probability is 43.75%If 3 siblings, probability is 57.8%HLA

responseComplications due to HLA mismatch may occur at any point after transplantWhen new donor immune system in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipient attacks recipient's tissues, it is called graft-vs.host diseaseWhen recipient's immune system in any transplant setting attacks donor transplant organ/tissue/HPCs, it is called rejectionMay be due to cellular immunity, largely mediated by CD8 lymphocytesMay be due to humoral immunity, largely mediated by HLA antibodiesDifferent types or combined rejections may occur at any point after transplantContinued need for immunosuppressive

TRALI, TA-GVHD, and TRIMLeukoreduction has largely reduced risk of FNHTR and TRIMTRALI mitigation strategies have reduced TRALI by HLA testing female donors with previous pregnanciesTA-GVHD is prevented by irradiation or pathogen reduction of transfusions for recipients who are at riskImmune-mediated platelet refractoriness due to HLA antibodiesMay require HLA matched platelet transfusions from blood centers that HLA type their donorsMatch is only critical for HLA-A and HLA-B for platelet donors and platelet recipientsA matches are 4/4B matches may be U matches (donor is homozygous for one of heterozygous alleles in recipient, no foreign antigen mismatch)B matches may be X matches [donor has foreign antigen mismatch with similar HLA antigen, called cross-reactive epitope group or (CREG]C match is when 1 allele is complete mismatchD match is when 2 alleles are complete mismatchA and BU matches are best, as neither have foreign antigens that could be target of HLA antibodiesBX matches are better than C matches due to reduced antigenicity of BX antigen compared to complete mismatch antigenDisease AssociationsAssociation of certain HLA phenotypes with disease processes or illness has been known for yearsHLA phenotypes have been linked to autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases (viral and microbial), drug sensitivity reactions, and cancerHLA antigens are usually associated with autoimmune diseases with relapsing remitting courseSome HLA antigens may be protective against certain illnessesRelationship may be causative or simply associative and may infer risk

testing for D antigenPatient testing does not require weak D testing; if they type as D-negative, that is typically final answerNot detecting variants allows patient to be typed as Rh negative and not be exposed to potentially foreign epitopes on normal D antigensException: Neonates require weak D testing to confirm Rh negative testing when born to mother who is Rh negative and Rh immune globulin

antigen at low enough level that weak (≤ 2 +) or no agglutination is seen upon testing with typical monoclonal anti-D reagent> 150 weak D alleles have been identifiedWeak D is caused by variety of different point mutations in RHD gene, which cause amino acid changes on intracellular or transmembrane portion of proteinChanges cause inefficient processing of protein from endoplasmic reticulum to cell surfaceMost do not cause changes in extracellular epitopesWeak D types 1, 2, 3 are most common types of weak D (making up ~ 90% of weak D phenotypes in people of European descent)Classic weak D patients do not produce anti-D when exposed to D+ red cellsPatients can receive D-positive red cells without concernPregnant patients do not need Rh immune globulinIncludes weak D type 1, 2, 3Some types of weak D alleles can potentially lead to anti-D formationPatients should not receive D-positive red cells and should be treated as D-negativePregnant patients do need Rh immune globulinIncludes

patients have 26 D antigens/cell (D+ has 10,000-30,000 D antigens/cell, and weak D type 1 has 967 D antigens/cell, for comparison)DEL phenotypes have been implicated as cause of RhD alloimmunization when RhD-negative/DEL-positive red cells were unknowingly transfused to RhD-negative recipientsDEL phenotypes are found more commonly among persons of Asian ancestry (10-30% of all D- Asians)Partial DHistorically, reactivity, and strength of reactivity, of partial D patient/donor red cells with anti-D reagents depends on D-epitopes present as well as particular D reagent usedMost licensed monoclonal D antisera will have similar reaction strength when used on partial D RBCs or normal D RBCsPartial D patients often type as D+, but then form anti-D from exposure to D+ red cells (of normal phenotype) and can cause clinically significant hemolytic transfusion reactions and HDFNPartial D phenotypes are associated with amino acid substitutions in RhD protein on extracellular surface of RhD protein, leading to lack of common D epitopes> 30 immunogenic epitopes on DDIIIa, DVI, DBT, and DFR are common partial D phenotypesIn United States, most persons expressing partial D phenotypes are of African ancestryMost common partial D phenotype in African Americans is DIIIa, which provides strong reactions with commonly used anti-D reagentsPartial DVI is most common partial D phenotype in people of European descentCommercially marketed panels of monoclonal reagents are available to differentiate number of partial D types, but D genotyping is superior technique for identification and discrimination of partial DMonoclonal anti-D reagents licensed in United States for patient testing intentionally do not detect partial DVI as RhD-positive by initial testing, due to known anti-D

acquired form of TTPcTTP: Congenital TTP is congenital form of TTPTherapeutic plasma exchange removes anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibody and replaces ADAMTS13Has reduced mortality of this disease to < 10%CLINICAL CORRELATESPathophysiologyDisease process is driven by severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motifs, member 13), which specifically cleaves ultra-large von Willebrand factor (ULVWF) multimersUncontrolled, ULVWF strings form in microcirculation, resulting in thrombocytopenia due to platelet-adhesion to ULWVF, and leading to microvascular obstruction (ischemia) and mechanical damage to red blood cells (anemia, often with schistiocytes)Congenital and acquired forms of disease existAcquired formsAssociated with autoantibody against ADAMTS13IgG4 is most common anti-ADAMTS13 IgG subclassCongenital formsAssociated with diminished or absent production of ADAMTS13EpidemiologyAnnual incidence: 1.5-3 cases per million patientsClassic Clinical FindingsClassic pentad: Rare for all 5 clinical changes to be presentThrombocytopeniaMicroangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA)Mental status changesRenal failureFever (usually not seen clinically)10-40% report infection or flu-like symptoms in weeks preceding diagnosisClinical findings of unexplained thrombocytopenia and MAHA are usually sufficient to clinically diagnose TTP todayAlthough platelet counts can be very low (< 10 K), patients with TTP have thrombotic (stroke/MI) rather than hemorrhagic tendencies (can see increased troponins or ST elevation)General MAHA signs and symptoms includeAnemia and thrombocytopeniaMucocutaneous bleeding or purpura when platelets fall < 20 KIncrease in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)Fall in haptoglobinSchistocytes on peripheral blood smearSchistocytes are not required to render diagnosis of acquired TTPCases of TTP without schistocytes often have delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and have worse outcomes due to delayed treatmentHemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuriaRenal dysfunction (increased creatinine/BUN)Mild acute kidney injury with creatinine < 2 mg/dL is typical of TTPNeurologic symptoms, ranging from confusion to coma, are present in > 60% of patientsTreatmentPlasma exchange (use 100% plasma: FFP or cryo-poor plasma)Plasma exchange removes anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibody and replaces ADAMTS13Considered category I (1st line) indication for plasma exchange according to American Society for Apheresis (ASFA)Treatment is usually initiated urgently within 4-8 hours of diagnostic suspicion (considered medical emergency)Plasma infusions can be given until plasma exchange can be initiated, if not rapidly availablePlasma exchange is generally performed daily until platelet count is > 150 x 10^9 /L, and LDH < 1.5 upper limit of normal for 2-3 consecutive daysMedical (medication) managementCorticosteroids are often used as primary adjunct to plasma exchange (1 mg per kg of body weight, per day)Rituximab is often used to treat refractory/relapsing casesUse is now increasing for this as primary adjunct therapeutic agentCyclosporine, bortezomib, azathioprine, vincristine, and splenectomy can also be used in refractory casesCaplacizumab: Blocks platelet binding sites in vWF to help reduce severity of TTP but does not reduce autoantibodyBlood product usePlatelets should only be transfused for potential life-threatening bleeding (otherwise it should be avoided)Transfusion of RBCs can be used to treat associated anemiaDifferent forms of frozen plasma, including cryoprecipitate reduced plasma, are used as replacement solution for therapeutic plasma exchangeResponse to treatmentClinical response: Normalization of platelet count and LDH after 5 therapeutic plasma exchangesClinical remission: Sustained clinical response for > 30 days after discontinuing therapeutic plasma exchangeExacerbation: Initial clinical response followed by decline in platelets and rise in LDH < 30 days after discontinuing therapeutic plasma exchangeRelapse: Initial clinical remission (> 30 days after discontinuing therapeutic plasma exchange) followed by subsequent decrease in platelet count and rising LDHRefractory: Persistent severe thrombocytopenia (< 50 x 10^9/L) and persistently elevated LDH (> 1.5x upper limit of normal) despite 5 therapeutic plasma exchange proceduresSome call it \"severe refractory\" if platelet count remains < 30 x 10^9/LPreventionIn congenital cases, routine/scheduled transfusions of FFP have been prophylactically used in some patients to maintain normal ADAMTS13 levels at times of riskMay be as infrequent as every 2-3 weeks given half-life of ADAMTS13 (up to 5 days)Routine monitoring of ADAMTS13 activity levels in patients at increased risk of relapse for TTP may help guide management after clinical remissionPreemptive therapy with rituximab or cyclosporine may be considered in patients with low ADAMTS13 activity without clinical manifestationsPrognosisPlasma exchange

              "CLINICAL CORRELATES": "PathophysiologyDisease process is driven by severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motifs, member 13), which specifically cleaves ultra-large von Willebrand factor (ULVWF) multimersUncontrolled, ULVWF strings form in microcirculation, resulting in thrombocytopenia due to platelet-adhesion to ULWVF, and leading to microvascular obstruction (ischemia) and mechanical damage to red blood cells (anemia, often with schistiocytes)Congenital and acquired forms of disease existAcquired formsAssociated with autoantibody against ADAMTS13IgG4 is most common anti-ADAMTS13 IgG subclassCongenital formsAssociated with diminished or absent production of ADAMTS13EpidemiologyAnnual incidence: 1.5-3 cases per million patientsClassic Clinical FindingsClassic pentad: Rare for all 5 clinical changes to be presentThrombocytopeniaMicroangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA)Mental status changesRenal failureFever (usually not seen clinically)10-40% report infection or flu-like symptoms in weeks preceding diagnosisClinical findings of unexplained thrombocytopenia and MAHA are usually sufficient to clinically diagnose TTP todayAlthough platelet counts can be very low (< 10 K), patients with TTP have thrombotic (stroke/MI) rather than hemorrhagic tendencies (can see increased troponins or ST elevation)General MAHA signs and symptoms includeAnemia and thrombocytopeniaMucocutaneous bleeding or purpura when platelets fall < 20 KIncrease in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)Fall in haptoglobinSchistocytes on peripheral blood smearSchistocytes are not required to render diagnosis of acquired TTPCases of TTP without schistocytes often have delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and have worse outcomes due to delayed treatmentHemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuriaRenal dysfunction (increased creatinine/BUN)Mild acute kidney injury with creatinine < 2 mg/dL is typical of TTPNeurologic symptoms, ranging from confusion to coma, are present in > 60% of patients\nTreatmentPlasma exchange (use 100% plasma: FFP or cryo-poor plasma)Plasma exchange removes anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibody and replaces ADAMTS13Considered category I (1st line) indication for plasma exchange according to American Society for Apheresis (ASFA)Treatment is usually initiated urgently within 4-8 hours of diagnostic suspicion (considered medical emergency)Plasma infusions can be given until plasma exchange can be initiated, if not rapidly availablePlasma exchange is generally performed daily until platelet count is > 150 x 10^9 /L, and LDH < 1.5 upper limit of normal for 2-3 consecutive daysMedical (medication) managementCorticosteroids are often used as primary adjunct to plasma exchange (1 mg per kg of body weight, per day)Rituximab is often used to treat refractory/relapsing casesUse is now increasing for this as primary adjunct therapeutic agentCyclosporine, bortezomib, azathioprine, vincristine, and splenectomy can also be used in refractory casesCaplacizumab: Blocks platelet binding sites in vWF to help reduce severity of TTP but does not reduce autoantibodyBlood product usePlatelets should only be transfused for potential life-threatening bleeding (otherwise it should be avoided)Transfusion of RBCs can be used to treat associated anemiaDifferent forms of frozen plasma, including cryoprecipitate reduced plasma, are used as replacement solution for therapeutic plasma exchangeResponse to treatmentClinical response: Normalization of platelet count and LDH after 5 therapeutic plasma exchangesClinical remission: Sustained clinical response for > 30 days after discontinuing therapeutic plasma exchangeExacerbation: Initial clinical response followed by decline in platelets and rise in LDH < 30 days after discontinuing therapeutic plasma exchangeRelapse: Initial clinical remission (> 30 days after discontinuing therapeutic plasma exchange) followed by subsequent decrease in platelet count and rising LDHRefractory: Persistent severe thrombocytopenia (< 50 x 10^9/L) and persistently elevated LDH (> 1.5x upper limit of normal) despite 5 therapeutic plasma exchange proceduresSome call it \"severe refractory\" if platelet count remains < 30 x 10^9/LPreventionIn congenital cases, routine/scheduled transfusions of FFP have been prophylactically used in some patients to maintain normal ADAMTS13 levels at times of riskMay be as infrequent as every 2-3 weeks given half-life of ADAMTS13 (up to 5 days)Routine monitoring of ADAMTS13 activity levels in patients at increased risk of relapse for TTP may help guide management after clinical remissionPreemptive therapy with rituximab or cyclosporine may be considered in patients with low ADAMTS13 activity without clinical manifestations\nPrognosisPlasma exchange has decreased overall mortality of acquired immune mediated TTP from > 90% fatal down to < 10%Differential DiagnosisDisseminated

unit was given before unit was stopped, and timing of transfusion until reaction was noted)Reaction symptoms (What did patient feel?)Reaction vitals and physical exam findings (prereaction vitals are helpful to compare with reaction vitals reported)Medications used to treat reaction (What and how much?)Reaction resolution (Did patient get better?\nRequire increased medical care, e.g., intubation?\nExpire?)Step 3: Narrow diagnosis and determine if additional tests are neededDifferential diagnosis of most acute transfusion reactions can be simplified by determining dominant reported patient symptomIf fever predominates, hemolytic transfusion reactions, transfusion-related sepsis, febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, and underlying medical conditions are favoredPatient underlying diagnosisFever during transfusion in patient with known sepsis or neutropenic fever increases chance that underlying medical condition contributedTiming of feverFevers that develop early during transfusion may favor significant hemolytic transfusion reactions and transfusion-related sepsisSeverity of feverHigh spiking fevers (103°F) favor significant transfusion-related sepsisChanges in blood pressureHypertension: Often seen in febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactionsHypotension: Can be seen in significant hemolytic transfusion reactions and transfusion-related sepsisResults of direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and unit clerical checkThis should be done on all cases of fever in context of red cell transfusionNegative result strongly suggests that hemolysis was not cause of fever (favors other causes)Results of postreaction blood cultures (if suspected based on other symptoms)Positive blood culture from both patient and transfused unit where organism identified is same in both is strong evidence for transfusion-related sepsisIf shortness of breath with hypoxia predominates, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion-associated cardiac overload (TACO), and anaphylaxis are favoredHistory of significant heart or renal diseaseKnown history of patient volume status issues increases risk of symptomatic cardiac overload from transfusionPatient ageOlder patients are more at risk for cardiac overload eventsTransfusion infusion rateIn nonbleeding patients, rapid infusion rates increase risk of symptomatic cardiac overloadChanges in blood pressureHypertension: Favors TACOHypotension: Favors TRALI or anaphylaxisRespiratory exam findingsWheezing favors anaphylaxisCrackles or visible pink frothy sputum favors TRALI/TACOResults of chest x-ray (should be done in all cases of transfusion-associated events involving dyspnea/hypoxia)Bilateral pulmonary edema favors TRALI/TACO over anaphylaxisCardiomegaly favors TACO over TRALI/anaphylaxisResponse to medical therapyNoted clinical improvement with diuretic favors TACO (not TRALI)Noted clinical improvement with epinephrine or steroids favors anaphylaxis (not TRALI)If pruritus or hives predominate, allergic transfusion reaction is favoredTemporally associate medications or eventsPatient may be allergic to something else that was givenSymptom severity is important to clarify (not all hives are created equal)Periorbital or perioral edema is concerning for more severe allergic reactionReported shortness of breath or wheezing is concerning for more severe reactionReported decreases in blood pressure are concerning for more severe reactionResponse to medical therapyNoted clinical improvement with simple antihistamine (i.e., benadryl) favors mild reactionReactions that require steroids for symptomatic relief are more severeStep 4: Decide if you need to quarantine any units or notify your blood providerQuarantine/notify after suspected septic transfusion reaction when blood products from same donor are availableQuarantine/notify after suspected TRALI reaction when blood products from same donor are availableStep 5: Decide if patient is safe to receive future transfusionsCan be considered under certain circumstancesPatient cannot wait due to medical needReaction or likely diagnosis is benign (i.e., febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions)Etiology is clear, or preventive steps have been taken to reduce future riskExample (1) using C-negative blood in patient with new anti-CExample (2) volume reducing or washing products for severe/recurrent allergic transfusion reactionsChance of similar reaction with new product is lowi.e., chance that second product is also bacterially contaminated is very lowApproach to Patient by TransfusionistWhen transfusion reaction is suspected, stop transfusion immediatelyKeep IV line used for transfusion open with normal salineMay be critical for appropriate and timely administration of necessary treatments for adverse eventPerform clerical recheckCompare blood product label information to blood product tag informationCompare blood product label and tag information to patient informationNotify clinical ordering provider for appropriate interventions\nTreatment of symptoms may need to be initiated as soon as possibleCollect appropriate specimens for diagnostic workupSome

          "CLINICAL CORRELATES": "Classic Clinical FindingsHematopoietic progenitor cell infusion process is simple, but multiple complications can occurInfusion processProduct and patient must be identified correctly at bedsideProduct is infused using intravenous (IV) drip directly into central line, typically without needle or pumpPatient vital signs should be measured before infusion, during infusion, immediately after infusion, and 1 hr after infusion at minimumTo maximize infusion of stem cells, bag and IV tubing can be flushed with saline into patient after bag emptiesProduct is infused as fast as patient can tolerateAssociated adverse eventsMost common reported side effects during infusion are mildCoughThroat tickleNausea/emesisMild changes in blood pressure and heart rateReactions associated with infusion can be very similar to reactions seen with other blood product transfusionsCardiac overloadAllergic reactionFebrile nonhemolytic reactionSepsisABO incompatibility is major contributor to adverse eventsHemolytic reactions can occur when donor and recipient ABO type is differentMajor ABO mismatches (recipient has antibodies against donor red cells, non-group O donor to group O recipient) are most likely to cause immediate acute hemolytic reactionsAdverse symptoms from hemolysis: Fever, back pain, chills, blood pressure changes, renal dysfunction, pain at infusion site, sense of doom, hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria, disseminated intravascular coagulationRisk is reduced as much as possible by use of red cell and plasma reduction techniques after collectionFor ABO major mismatch products, RBC content < 15 mL typically well toleratedDelayed RBC engraftment, and rarely, pure red cell aplasia may also occur when persistent ABO antibodies against donor RBCsDelayed hemolysis can occur in minor ABO mismatch (donor has antibodies against recipient red cells, group O donor to non-group O recipient) when donor passenger lymphocytes engraft and create ABO antibodies while recipient RBCs still in circulationDelayed hemolysis typically occurs > 2 weeks after transplantBidirectional ABO mismatch can have all adverse events associated with ABO mismatch (group A donor to group B recipient or group B donor to group A recipient)Effects from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (5-10%)Common adverse symptoms: Pruritus, urticaria, flushing, wheezing, fever, nausea, emesis, cough, headacheRisk reduced by use of smaller volume products or post-thaw washed/diluted larger volume productsMild adverse symptoms of nausea, flushing, and headache very commonProphylactic medications/treatments commonly used with stem cell infusionAggressive IV hydration before and after infusion with use of diuretics, antiemetics, antipyretics, and antihistaminesTransplant physician and cell therapy laboratory should be notified of unexpected or moderate/severe reaction to infusionCause of reaction should be determined with direct antiglobulin test, antibody titer, Gram stain, or bacterial blood cultureData on patient longer term clinical outcomes, such as time to engraftment, should also be reviewed regularly as quality improvement measureEngraftmentEngraftment of WBCs (measured by absolute neutrophil count) and PLTs is critical to outcome of transplantAbsolute neutrophil count > 500/uL for 3 consecutive days designates neutrophil engraftment date (time from transplant to 1st of 3 consecutive days counted as date of engraftment)Platelet count > 20,000/uL for 3 consecutive days, without platelet transfusion in preceeding 7 days, designates platelet engraftment date (time from transplant to 1st of 3 consecutive days)Chimerism studies are important for allogeneic transplants, to monitor for donor engraftment of lymphocytesRBC engraftment can be difficult to determine due to long life span of circulating RBCs; use of reticulocyte counts may be more accurateDelayed engraftments, primary engraftment failures (never engrafted), and secondary engraftment failures (failed after successful engraftment) should be monitored and managedAdditional transplants with HPC boosts, backup HPCs, or even additional transplants may be necessary for engraftment failures"

often associated with other allelesHLA typing allows for matching of appropriate stem cell donor and recipient pairsCLINICAL APPLICATIONSHLA AntigensHLA antigens: Glycoproteins on body's cell surfaces

HLA-A, B, CHLA II: HLA-DR, DQ, DPContribute to followingRecognition of self and nonself antigensDirectly involved in immune response to antigenic stimuliDirectly involved in coordination of both cellular and humoral immunityHLA system presents antigen on class I and class II HLA antigensClass I HLA antigens present antigens on surface of all nucleated cells in body (platelets typically have HLA-A and -B but can also have -C)Mature RBCs may express residual HLA class I antigens on their surface (Bennett-Goodspeed antigens, Bg)Purpose is to express different intracellular proteins (endogenous proteins) on cell surface for immune surveillanceIf cell expresses abnormal proteins, such as foreign antigens from viruses, or abnormal proteins due to neoplastic change, then immune system can target cell for removalCD8 T lymphocytes typically are immune cell that signals infected or malignant cell to undergo cell deathCritical to cellular immunity and may influence humoral

portions of both HLA haplotypes from one parent are inherited by childExampleIf father had crossover event, he may given A3, B56 or A11, B55 due to crossover between HLA A and B lociThus, additional

situations)TERMINOLOGYAbbreviationsRed blood cell (RBC)Antihuman globulin (AHG)Immediate spin (IS)US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)LABORATORY METHODSCompatibility Testing (Crossmatch)Major vs. minor crossmatch: Outdated terminologyMajor crossmatch was described when there was incubation of patient plasma with donor RBCs to determine incompatibility of donor RBCs with recipient plasma antibodiesTerm \"major crossmatch\" is not typically usedNow this is typically called serologic crossmatchMinor crossmatch was described when there was incubation of patient RBCs with donor plasma to determine incompatibility of recipient RBCs with donor plasma antibodiesNot required or often performedWas used for whole-blood compatibility testing due to potential risk of incompatible donor plasma antibodiesDifferent crossmatch methodsAHG crossmatch, a type of serologic crossmatchRequired for patients with past or current history of non-ABO alloantibodiesUsed to detect incompatibility between patient's plasma and non-ABO and ABO antigens on donor RBCsAgglutination or hemolysis constitutes positive (incompatible) test resultAHG crossmatch can be performed using tube, gel, or solid phase methodologiesIS crossmatch, a type of serologic crossmatchDesigned to detect ABO incompatibility onlyDetects plasma antibodies that react at room temperatureAgglutination or hemolysis constitutes positive (incompatible) test resultMay detect clinically insignificant cold autoantibodies or rouleauxAdequate crossmatch method if patient has no previous history of clinically significant antibody and current antibody screen is negativeElectronic crossmatch, alternative to serologic crossmatchAcceptable alternative to IS crossmatch for patients with no previous or current history of clinically significant antibodiesDesigned to prevent ABO incompatibilitySimilar to IS crossmatchTransfusion service can perform computer confirmation of ABO compatibility without any serologic testing whenTransfusion service has FDA-approved computer system that is validated on sitePatient/recipient has 2 determinations of ABO group on record in blood bank (one of which is current sample), negative antibody screen, and no past history of clinically significant antibodiesTransfusion service has method to verify correct entry of data before release of blood componentApproved computer system contains logic to alert user to discrepancies between donor and recipient ABO/RhApproved computer system contains and retains adequate donor (ID number, component name, ABO/Rh type) and patient information (ABO/Rh type, antibody screen results, compatibility results)Labeling and release of blood components after crossmatchAt time of issue, following must occurFinal check of records is performed to ensure that all recipient information and transfusion requirements are consistent and correctTag or label is attached securely to unit withAt least 2 independent recipient identifiers (i.e., name and medical record number)Patient ABO group and Rh typeDonor unit number, donor ABO group, and Rh type (if required)Compatibility testing results, if performedSpecial transfusion requirements, if requestedExpiration date (and time if appliable)Confirmation that identifying information on request, records, and components matchConfirmation that unit color, integrity (no leaks), and outdate are acceptableSpecial compatibility situationsEmergency bloodIn emergency situations, crossmatch does not need to be done and pretransfusion testing does not need to be completed before issuing bloodRecords must contain signed statement from ordering physician indicating that clinical situation was sufficiently urgent to bypass testingTag must clearly indicate that compatibility test was not completed at time of issuePretransfusion tests and compatibility tests must be completed as soon as possible after release of unitIf incompatibility is detected, ordering physician and transfusion service medical director should be immediately notifiedGroup O, D negative red cells are preferred when patient is woman of childbearing ageABO and D compatible units can be used if current blood sample has been completedTrauma patients often stratify female patients into females of child bearing potential vs. females not of child bearing potentialO negative RBCs may be reserved for massive transfusion of females of child bearing potential of unknown ABO typeO positive RBCs may be used for massive transfusion of males and females not of child bearing potential of unknown ABO typeSwitch to type specific once ABO/Rh type of patient becomes known upon completion of testing, which may occur while massive transfusion protocol is still activeNeonates If unexpected antibodies are not present, it is unnecessary to crossmatch RBC units for initial or subsequent transfusionsRepeat pretransfusion testing may be omitted for duration of hospitalization or until 4 months of age, whichever is soonerIf clinically significant antibodies of maternal origin are present, antigen-negative or crossmatch compatible blood is transfused until antibody is no longer detectable",
          "CLINICAL APPLICATIONS": "Red Cell Component SelectionABO compatibilityBlood components should ideally be ABO-identical with transfusion recipientWhen this is not possible, compatible units need to be selectedIn blood components containing ≥ 2 mL of red cells, donor red cells must be compatible with recipient's plasmaD compatibilityRBC-containing components should be matched for D-antigen (red cell, granulocyte, whole blood, and pooled whole blood-derived platelets)Pooled whole blood derived platelets often have > 0.03 mL of RBCs, which has been reported as enough D+ RBCs to cause anti-D alloimmunizationD-positive RBC-containing units can be considered for D-negative patients whenMedical urgency outweighs risk of anti-D formationThis may also occur when known O negative patient who is male or a female not of child bearing potential is in continued need of transfusion support and O negative RBC supply becomes critically lowDepending on how critically low O negative supply is, even females of child bearing potential may be issued O positive RBCsRisk of anti-D formation is significantly reducedApheresis platelet components have very low RBC content, well below typical threshold of 0.03 mL D+ RBCs to allow alloanti-D antibodies to developRh factor immunoglobulin can be used in some situations to prevent anti-D formationRisk of hemolysis must be taken into consideration if exposed to large volume of D-positive red cellsOther red cell antigensUsually not needed in nonalloimmunized patientsIn patients with known alloantibodies, corresponding antigen-negative units selected for compatibility testingProphylactic antigen matching (C, c, E, e, K, k) is often used for specific populationsSuch as patients with sickle cell disease"

different point mutations in RHD gene, which cause amino acid changes on intracellular or transmembrane portion of proteinChanges cause inefficient processing of protein from endoplasmic reticulum to cell surfaceMost do not cause changes in extracellular epitopesWeak D types 1, 2, 3 are most common types of weak D (making up ~ 90% of weak D phenotypes in people of European descent)Classic weak D

patients have 26 D antigens/cell (D+ has 10,000-30,000 D antigens/cell, and weak D type 1 has 967 D antigens/cell, for comparison)DEL phenotypes have been implicated as cause of RhD alloimmunization when RhD-negative/DEL-positive red cells were unknowingly transfused to RhD-negative recipientsDEL phenotypes are found more commonly among persons of Asian ancestry (10-30% of all D- Asians)Partial DHistorically, reactivity, and strength of reactivity, of partial D patient/donor red cells with anti-D reagents depends on D-epitopes present as well as particular D reagent usedMost licensed monoclonal D antisera will have similar reaction strength when used on partial D RBCs or normal D RBCsPartial D patients often type as D+, but then form anti-D from exposure to D+ red cells (of normal phenotype) and can cause clinically significant hemolytic transfusion reactions and HDFNPartial D phenotypes are associated with amino acid substitutions in RhD protein on extracellular surface of RhD

        "raw_text": "KEY CONCEPTSClinical CorrelatesThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): Caused by severe deficiency of ADAMTS13, often caused by autoantibodyiTTP: Immune-mediated TTP is acquired form of TTPcTTP: Congenital TTP is congenital form of TTPTherapeutic plasma exchange removes anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibody and replaces ADAMTS13Has reduced mortality of this disease to < 10%CLINICAL CORRELATESPathophysiologyDisease process is driven by severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motifs, member 13), which specifically cleaves ultra-large von Willebrand factor (ULVWF) multimersUncontrolled, ULVWF strings form in microcirculation, resulting in thrombocytopenia due to platelet-adhesion to ULWVF, and leading to microvascular obstruction (ischemia) and mechanical damage to red blood cells (anemia, often with schistiocytes)Congenital and acquired forms of disease existAcquired formsAssociated with autoantibody against ADAMTS13IgG4 is most common anti-ADAMTS13 IgG subclassCongenital formsAssociated with diminished or absent production of ADAMTS13EpidemiologyAnnual incidence: 1.5-3 cases per million patientsClassic Clinical FindingsClassic pentad: Rare for all 5 clinical changes to be presentThrombocytopeniaMicroangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA)Mental status changesRenal failureFever (usually not seen clinically)10-40% report infection or flu-like symptoms in weeks preceding diagnosisClinical findings of unexplained thrombocytopenia and MAHA are usually sufficient to clinically diagnose TTP todayAlthough platelet counts can be very low (< 10 K), patients with TTP have thrombotic (stroke/MI) rather than hemorrhagic tendencies (can see increased troponins or ST elevation)General MAHA signs and symptoms includeAnemia and thrombocytopeniaMucocutaneous bleeding or purpura when platelets fall < 20 KIncrease in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)Fall in haptoglobinSchistocytes on peripheral blood smearSchistocytes are not required to render diagnosis of acquired TTPCases of TTP without schistocytes often have delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and have worse outcomes due to delayed treatmentHemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuriaRenal dysfunction (increased creatinine/BUN)Mild acute kidney injury with creatinine < 2 mg/dL is typical of TTPNeurologic symptoms, ranging from confusion to coma, are present in > 60% of patientsTreatmentPlasma exchange (use 100% plasma: FFP or cryo-poor plasma)Plasma exchange removes anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibody and replaces ADAMTS13Considered category I (1st line) indication for plasma exchange according to American Society for Apheresis (ASFA)Treatment is usually initiated urgently within 4-8 hours of diagnostic suspicion (considered medical emergency)Plasma infusions can be given until plasma exchange can be initiated, if not rapidly availablePlasma exchange is generally performed daily until platelet count is > 150 x 10^9 /L, and LDH < 1.5 upper limit of normal for 2-3 consecutive daysMedical (medication) managementCorticosteroids are often used as primary adjunct to plasma exchange (1 mg per kg of body weight, per day)Rituximab is often used to treat refractory/relapsing casesUse is now increasing for this as primary adjunct therapeutic agentCyclosporine, bortezomib, azathioprine, vincristine, and splenectomy can also be used in refractory casesCaplacizumab: Blocks platelet binding sites in vWF to help reduce severity of TTP but does not reduce autoantibodyBlood product usePlatelets should only be transfused for potential life-threatening bleeding (otherwise it should be avoided)Transfusion of RBCs can be used to treat associated anemiaDifferent forms of frozen plasma, including cryoprecipitate reduced plasma, are used as replacement solution for therapeutic plasma exchangeResponse to treatmentClinical response: Normalization of platelet count and LDH after 5 therapeutic plasma exchangesClinical remission: Sustained clinical response for > 30 days after discontinuing therapeutic plasma exchangeExacerbation: Initial clinical response followed by decline in platelets and rise in LDH < 30 days after discontinuing therapeutic plasma exchangeRelapse: Initial clinical remission (> 30 days after discontinuing therapeutic plasma exchange) followed by subsequent decrease in platelet count and rising LDHRefractory: Persistent severe thrombocytopenia (< 50 x 10^9/L) and persistently elevated LDH (> 1.5x upper limit of normal) despite 5 therapeutic plasma exchange proceduresSome call it \"severe refractory\" if platelet count remains < 30 x 10^9/LPreventionIn congenital cases, routine/scheduled transfusions of FFP have been prophylactically used in some patients to maintain normal ADAMTS13 levels at times of riskMay be as infrequent as every 2-3 weeks given half-life of ADAMTS13 (up to 5 days)Routine monitoring of ADAMTS13 activity levels in patients at increased risk of relapse for TTP may help guide management after clinical remissionPreemptive therapy with rituximab or cyclosporine may be considered in patients with low ADAMTS13 activity without clinical manifestationsPrognosisPlasma exchange has decreased overall mortality of acquired immune mediated TTP from > 90% fatal down to < 10%Differential DiagnosisDisseminated intravascular coagulationMultiple causes of DIC: Sepsis, malignancy, hematologic disorder, trauma, obstetric complicationsSevere malignant hypertensionSevere and uncontrolled hypertension resulting in acute end organ dysfunction and thrombotic microangiopathyPernicious anemia (vitamin B12 deficiency)Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) of other causesCoagulation mutations: THBD, DGKE, PLG mutations resulting in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome that may be refractory to eculizumabComplement mediated (also known as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome): Congenital mutation often with disease triggered by acute eventDrug associated: Ticlopidine, clopidogrel, gemcitabine, quinine, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, etc.Infection associated: Hemolytic uremic syndrome due to Shiga toxin-producing E. coli or Streptococcus pneumoniaeTransplant associated: Stem cell or

          "CLINICAL CORRELATES": "PathophysiologyDisease process is driven by severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motifs, member 13), which specifically cleaves ultra-large von Willebrand factor (ULVWF) multimersUncontrolled, ULVWF strings form in microcirculation, resulting in thrombocytopenia due to platelet-adhesion to ULWVF, and leading to microvascular obstruction (ischemia) and mechanical damage to red blood cells (anemia, often with schistiocytes)Congenital and acquired forms of disease existAcquired formsAssociated with autoantibody against ADAMTS13IgG4 is most common anti-ADAMTS13 IgG subclassCongenital formsAssociated with diminished or absent production of ADAMTS13EpidemiologyAnnual incidence: 1.5-3 cases per million patientsClassic Clinical FindingsClassic pentad: Rare for all 5 clinical changes to be presentThrombocytopeniaMicroangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA)Mental status changesRenal failureFever (usually not seen clinically)10-40% report infection or flu-like symptoms in weeks preceding diagnosisClinical findings of unexplained thrombocytopenia and MAHA are usually sufficient to clinically diagnose TTP todayAlthough platelet counts can be very low (< 10 K), patients with TTP have thrombotic (stroke/MI) rather than hemorrhagic tendencies (can see increased troponins or ST elevation)General MAHA signs and symptoms includeAnemia and thrombocytopeniaMucocutaneous bleeding or purpura when platelets fall < 20 KIncrease in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)Fall in haptoglobinSchistocytes on peripheral blood smearSchistocytes are not required to render diagnosis of acquired TTPCases of TTP without schistocytes often have delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and have worse outcomes due to delayed treatmentHemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuriaRenal dysfunction (increased creatinine/BUN)Mild acute kidney injury with creatinine < 2 mg/dL is typical of TTPNeurologic symptoms, ranging from confusion to coma, are present in > 60% of patients\nTreatmentPlasma exchange (use 100% plasma: FFP or cryo-poor plasma)Plasma exchange removes anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibody and replaces ADAMTS13Considered category I (1st line) indication for plasma exchange according to American Society for Apheresis (ASFA)Treatment is usually initiated urgently within 4-8 hours of diagnostic suspicion (considered medical emergency)Plasma infusions can be given until plasma exchange can be initiated, if not rapidly availablePlasma exchange is generally performed daily until platelet count is > 150 x 10^9 /L, and LDH < 1.5 upper limit of normal for 2-3 consecutive daysMedical (medication) managementCorticosteroids are often used as primary adjunct to plasma exchange (1 mg per kg of body weight, per day)Rituximab is often used to treat refractory/relapsing casesUse is now increasing for this as primary adjunct therapeutic agentCyclosporine, bortezomib, azathioprine, vincristine, and splenectomy can also be used in refractory casesCaplacizumab: Blocks platelet binding sites in vWF to help reduce severity of TTP but does not reduce autoantibodyBlood product usePlatelets should only be transfused for potential life-threatening bleeding (otherwise it should be avoided)Transfusion of RBCs can be used to treat associated anemiaDifferent forms of frozen plasma, including cryoprecipitate reduced plasma, are used as replacement solution for therapeutic plasma exchangeResponse to treatmentClinical response: Normalization of platelet count and LDH after 5 therapeutic plasma exchangesClinical remission: Sustained clinical response for > 30 days after discontinuing therapeutic plasma exchangeExacerbation: Initial clinical response followed by decline in platelets and rise in LDH < 30 days after discontinuing therapeutic plasma exchangeRelapse: Initial clinical remission (> 30 days after discontinuing therapeutic plasma exchange) followed by subsequent decrease in platelet count and rising LDHRefractory: Persistent severe thrombocytopenia (< 50 x 10^9/L) and persistently elevated LDH (> 1.5x upper limit of normal) despite 5 therapeutic plasma exchange proceduresSome call it \"severe refractory\" if platelet count remains < 30 x 10^9/LPreventionIn congenital cases, routine/scheduled transfusions of FFP have been prophylactically used in some patients to maintain normal ADAMTS13 levels at times of riskMay be as infrequent as every 2-3 weeks given half-life of ADAMTS13 (up to 5 days)Routine monitoring of ADAMTS13 activity levels in patients at increased risk of relapse for TTP may help guide management after clinical remissionPreemptive therapy with rituximab or cyclosporine may be considered in patients with low ADAMTS13 activity without clinical manifestations\nPrognosisPlasma exchange has decreased overall mortality of acquired immune mediated TTP from > 90% fatal down to < 10%Differential DiagnosisDisseminated intravascular coagulationMultiple causes of DIC: Sepsis, malignancy, hematologic disorder, trauma, obstetric complicationsSevere malignant hypertensionSevere and uncontrolled hypertension resulting in acute end organ dysfunction and thrombotic microangiopathyPernicious anemia (vitamin B12 deficiency)Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) of other causesCoagulation mutations: THBD, DGKE, PLG mutations resulting in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome that may be refractory to eculizumabComplement mediated (also known as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome): Congenital mutation often with disease triggered by acute eventDrug associated: Ticlopidine, clopidogrel, gemcitabine, quinine, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, etc.\nInfection associated: Hemolytic uremic syndrome due to Shiga toxin-producing E.
