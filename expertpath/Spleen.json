and review all available clinical information upfrontClinical information provides specific indication of splenectomyProves useful in appropriate sampling and processing of specimenRapid transfer of spleen to pathology laboratory once it is removed from patientPrevents autolysisIdeally, spleen should be sent fresh to pathology laboratory without prior exposure to fixativeFresh specimen allows for flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular assays when indicatedImportant to evaluate splenectomy specimen when fresh as soon as possibleThis step allows optimal preservation of tissue for subsequent histomorphologic evaluationCareful examination of key regions, including capsule, hilum, splenic red and white pulps, helps in histopathologic diagnosisGross Examination of External Surface of SpleenWeigh spleen and record itMeasure splenic width, height, and depthExamine splenic capsuleCapsule is thin and slightly wrinkled in normal spleenCapsule is tightly stretched over surface in congested spleenRecord external surface abnormalitiesTears, rupture, traumatic injuries, and surface groovesMeasure and record subcapsular hematomas, if anyThickened plaques should be recorded if notedDiffuse fibrosis covering spleen (perisplenitis/\"sugar-coated spleen\") may be seen due to portal hypertensionExamine for presence of separated splenic nodules (polysplenia)Photograph any external surface abnormalitiesGross Examination of Hilar Region of SpleenExamine splenic hilum, and dissect for lymph nodes and accessory spleenAdequately sample and submit hilar lymph nodesMay provide useful histopathologic representation of both splenic and nodal pathologySubmit accessory spleen (if present) for histologic examinationExamine hilar vasculature for potential abnormalities, such as splenic artery aneurysmRare abnormality that can lead to rupture and require splenectomyGross Examination of Splenic ParenchymaSplenic parenchyma should be evaluated after removal and

freeze portion of any suspicious lesion and save it at -70 °C for possible future studiesProper Fixation of SpleenAvoid unnecessary delay in transferring splenic slices to fixativeAmple amounts of blood and histiocytes in spleen facilitate rapid autolysisImmerse splenic slices in formalinRinse slices and replace formalin to remove as much blood from slices as possibleThick slices will limit fixation to only narrow rim at periphery of splenic tissueFix splenic slices overnight in ample amount of formalinAdequate fixation is crucial for preservation of architecture and detailed cytomorphologyLaparoscopic SplenectomySplenic tissue fragments are typically large enough to provide reliable histologic evaluationCareful gross examination is recommended to identify incidental

hyperechoic than liver parenchymaSplenic focal lesions are frequently subtle, often nonspecific, and are typically hypoechoic in appearanceAll focal heterogeneity detected on US should be further evaluated by other imaging modalitiesCTSpleen is homogeneous on unenhanced CTUnenhanced CT is mainly used to detect splenic calcificationNonhomogeneous pattern on enhanced CT during arterial and early portal venous phases after IV contrast injectionShould not be confused with splenic diseasesHomogeneous appearance of normal spleen during middle to late phases of contrast enhancementMRHomogeneous

lymphoid organ in bodySplenic MorphogenesisRecognized as bulge in dorsal mesogastrium at 33-41 days of gestationCondensation consists of long strip of mesenchymal cells adjacent to forming stomach above developing pancreasDorsal to greater curvature of stomachEmbryo at around 8 mm of crown to rump lengthVessels are observed at around 33 daysArises initially from branches of dorsal aortaMesenchymal cells are differentiated from dorsal mesogastriumMesenchymal cells eventually differentiate to form capsule, trabeculae, and reticular frameworkHematopoietic cells becomes detectable after 44 daysSplenic sinus formation starts around 49 daysSplenic hilum formation becomes evident after 49 daysSpleen becomes apparent after 49 days of embryonic ageParallel arteries and veins are observed around 56 daysSplenic lobules eventually fuse, and spleen acquires smooth, nonlobulated appearanceRotation of stomach carries spleen to left side of stomachSituated between origin of root of mesentery from anterior aspect of left kidney and stomach itselfInitially, spleen has role in hematopoiesis, then in immune system developmentBegin in 2nd month of fetal developmentFunctions as hematopoietic center until late fetal lifeCells required for hematopoietic function arise from yolk sac wall and near dorsal aortaHematopoiesis in spleen stops toward 3rd trimester and then moves to bone marrowT and B lymphocytes migrate to spleen and populate white pulp associated with trabeculaeLater, spleen plays significant role in immune systemCongenital AbnormalitiesCommon congenital anomaliesSplenic lobulation/lobulated spleenAccessory spleen (spleniculi)Small-sized functional spleen in presence of otherwise normal-sized spleenCommon locations include hilum of spleen and splenorenal and gastrosplenic ligamentsOther locations include tail of pancreas, jejunal wall, mesentery, and omentumFound in 10-30% of patients at autopsyRare congenital anomaliesWandering spleenPolyspleniaOften associated with other developmental abnormalitiesCardiac abnormalities, including dextrocardia, ventricular septal defect, ostium primum defectGastrointestinal abnormalities, including intestinal malrotation, duodenal atresia, biliary atresiaAbnormal left-right orientations of thoracic and abdominal organs (heterotaxia)Spleen may be present on right side and divided into multiple small piecesPolysplenia can occur alone without other congenital abnormalitiesSplenogonadal fusionAbnormal fusion of splenic and gonadal primordia during prenatal

AnatomyBean-shaped organ surrounded by fibrous capsule that extends inward to divide organ into lobulesRoughly triangular in cross sectionSimilar to lymph node in shape and structure but much largerDark red to blue-black in colorConsists of 2 types of tissueWhite pulpNumerous small nodules (1-2 mm) of lymphoid tissueRed pulpVenous sinuses filled with blood and cords of lymphatic cells (e.g., lymphocytes and macrophages)Blood supply via splenic arterySplenic artery enters at hilum and branches in spleenSpleen weight can be important in evaluationTypically 150-200 gVaries with sex, age, height, and weightSize and weight may show considerable variation related to amount of bloodSplenic hilumEntry point for splenic vessels and nervesExit point for efferent lymphaticsAttachment

composed of dense connective tissueSurrounds branching arteries, veins, and lymphaticsTrabecular arteriesEmerge from connective tissue and become arterioles of white pulp (central arterioles), which are surrounded by periarteriolar lymphatic sheathCentral arteriolesContinue into follicles (follicular arterioles)Follicular arteriolesBecome smaller and terminate in marginal zone or form vascular

diameter is considered active diseaseCT diagnosis of residual disease may lead to further chemotherapy, change of drug regimens, or radiotherapyCT is considered nonspecific to assess tumor viability in patients who received chemotherapyF-18 FDG PETConsidered one of most helpful noninvasive imaging techniquesBased on increased glucose metabolism of metabolically active (usually tumor) cellsFDG is taken up by cells, but not metabolized, and it is retained intracellularlyHodgkin lymphoma and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas are generally FDG avidFDG PET has been suggested as being more sensitive for B-cell than for T-cell lymphomasIndolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas show variable FDG avidityAdvantageous over CT scan in assessing stage and detection of residual disease or early tumor relapseAssessment of metabolic activity of cells in mass can predict tumor viability [high standardized uptake value (SUV)]Nonmetabolically active pseudotumors predict nonviable tumor and may prevent splenectomy~ 10-30% false-positive rate as determined by concomitant biopsiesRefining may be required for cases with higher SUV valuesCurrent recommendation is to obtain histologic confirmation in these lesionsMetabolically active necrotic masses may indicate presence of inflammatory or histiocytic reactionThis pattern is more significant in 1st few months after completion of therapyNecrotic

intervention is indicated in patients who are hemodynamically unstable or have ongoing blood lossCritical to attempt to salvage spleen in patients who require surgeryMild splenic injuries can be managed with electrocautery or absorbable sutureHemisplenectomy may be required in selected casesRapid splenectomy is required in patients with active splenic bleeding and severe splenic

injuriesLower rates of success in adultsAngiography and transcatheter embolizationUseful adjunct to nonoperative management May increase splenic salvage rate in selected patientsMajor complications include missed injuries, delayed bleeding, and splenic abscess\nPrognosisOverall mortality rate from splenic injury is ~ 6-7%Mortality is typically due to associated injuries and not directly due to splenic injury itselfComplications following surgical removal of injured spleenPostsplenectomy sepsisIncreased risk of infection for lifeAsplenic patients should be vaccinated against pneumococcal, meningococcal, and Haemophilus influenzae type B organismsYearly immunization against influenza virusesRare, long-term complication of ruptured spleen Splenosis due to autotransplantation of splenic

and review all available clinical information upfrontClinical information provides specific indication of splenectomyProves useful in appropriate sampling and processing of specimenRapid transfer of spleen to pathology laboratory once it is removed from patientPrevents autolysisIdeally, spleen should be sent fresh to pathology laboratory without prior exposure to fixativeFresh specimen allows for flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular assays when indicatedImportant to evaluate splenectomy specimen when fresh as soon as possibleThis step allows optimal preservation of tissue for subsequent histomorphologic evaluationCareful examination of key regions, including capsule, hilum, splenic red and white pulps, helps in histopathologic diagnosisGross Examination of External Surface of SpleenWeigh spleen and record itMeasure splenic width, height, and depthExamine splenic capsuleCapsule is thin and slightly wrinkled in normal spleenCapsule is tightly stretched over surface in congested spleenRecord external surface abnormalitiesTears, rupture, traumatic injuries, and surface groovesMeasure and record subcapsular hematomas, if anyThickened plaques should be recorded if notedDiffuse fibrosis covering spleen (perisplenitis/\"sugar-coated spleen\") may be seen due to portal hypertensionExamine for presence of separated splenic nodules (polysplenia)Photograph any external surface abnormalitiesGross Examination of Hilar Region of SpleenExamine splenic hilum, and dissect for lymph nodes and accessory spleenAdequately sample and submit hilar lymph nodesMay provide useful histopathologic representation of both splenic and nodal pathologySubmit accessory spleen (if present) for histologic examinationExamine hilar vasculature for potential abnormalities, such as splenic artery aneurysmRare abnormality that can lead to rupture and require splenectomyGross Examination of Splenic ParenchymaSplenic parenchyma should be evaluated after removal and processing of splenic hilar tissueSlice entire spleen perpendicular to long axis at ~ 5-mm intervalsWash and carefully examine each slice for grossly identifiable lesionsGrossly normal cut surface of spleen is red with scattered small white nodulesWhite nodules are ~ 1 mm in diameter in normal spleen and represent splenic white pulpAreas between white pulp represent splenic red pulpDiffuse red, beefy homogeneous cut surface may be seen inRed pulp infiltrative hematopoietic neoplasmsExtramedullary hematopoiesisFibrocongestive splenomegalyUniformly distributed prominent small white nodules (miliary pattern) can be seen inSmall B-cell lymphomasReactive lymphoid hyperplasiaLarge, single or large nodular masses may be seen inClassic Hodgkin lymphomaLarge B-cell lymphomaMetastatic

abnormality (if present)Prepare and examine Diff-Quik-stained touch imprint of any suspicious lesionCan help in determining if flow cytometry, cytogenetics, &/or molecular studies are neededSnap freeze portion of any suspicious lesion and save it at -70 °C for possible future studiesProper Fixation of SpleenAvoid unnecessary delay in transferring splenic slices to fixativeAmple amounts of blood and histiocytes in spleen facilitate rapid autolysisImmerse splenic slices in formalinRinse slices and replace formalin to remove as much blood from slices as possibleThick slices will limit fixation to only narrow rim at periphery of splenic tissueFix splenic slices overnight in ample amount of formalinAdequate fixation is crucial for preservation of architecture and detailed cytomorphologyLaparoscopic SplenectomySplenic tissue fragments are typically large enough to provide reliable histologic evaluationCareful gross examination is recommended to identify incidental abnormalitiesFragmented hilar tissue is typically included and can be identified grosslySearch for hilar lymph nodes and potential accessory spleen and submit for routine processingFormalin penetration is easier in fragmented splenic tissue obtained by laparoscopic splenectomyFine-Needle Aspiration and Core Biopsy of SpleenSplenic FNA &/or biopsy is common procedure in many parts of worldGenerally not performed in USA except in cases with solid massesSpleen WeightNormalNo universally accepted normal weight for spleen in adultsMean weight of 139 g (range: 43-344 g) is reported in young male adults in one autopsy studyNormally, small spleen can enlarge 2-3x and still remain within typical range due to wide range of normal weight of spleenSpleen weight decreases with ageSplenomegalyEnlargement of SpleenMost important finding that may indicate abnormality in spleenCan be detected by palpation or percussion when spleen extends beyond its anatomical limitsAccurate

organ in bodySplenic MorphogenesisRecognized as bulge in dorsal mesogastrium at 33-41 days of gestationCondensation consists of long strip of mesenchymal cells adjacent to forming stomach above developing pancreasDorsal to greater curvature of stomachEmbryo at around 8 mm of crown to rump lengthVessels are observed at around 33 daysArises initially from branches of dorsal aortaMesenchymal cells are differentiated from dorsal mesogastriumMesenchymal cells eventually differentiate to form capsule, trabeculae, and reticular frameworkHematopoietic cells becomes detectable after 44 daysSplenic sinus formation starts around 49 daysSplenic hilum formation becomes evident after 49 daysSpleen becomes apparent after 49 days of embryonic ageParallel arteries and veins are observed around 56 daysSplenic lobules eventually fuse, and spleen acquires smooth, nonlobulated appearanceRotation of stomach carries spleen to left side of stomachSituated between origin of root of mesentery from anterior aspect of left kidney and stomach itselfInitially, spleen has role in hematopoiesis, then in immune system developmentBegin in 2nd month of fetal developmentFunctions as hematopoietic center until late fetal lifeCells required for hematopoietic function arise from yolk sac wall and near dorsal aortaHematopoiesis in spleen stops toward 3rd trimester and then moves to bone marrowT and B lymphocytes migrate to spleen and populate white pulp associated with trabeculaeLater, spleen plays significant role in immune systemCongenital AbnormalitiesCommon congenital anomaliesSplenic lobulation/lobulated spleenAccessory spleen (spleniculi)Small-sized functional spleen in presence of otherwise normal-sized spleenCommon locations include hilum of spleen and splenorenal and gastrosplenic ligamentsOther locations include tail of pancreas, jejunal wall, mesentery, and omentumFound in 10-30% of patients at autopsyRare congenital anomaliesWandering spleenPolyspleniaOften associated with other developmental abnormalitiesCardiac abnormalities, including dextrocardia, ventricular septal defect, ostium primum defectGastrointestinal abnormalities, including intestinal malrotation, duodenal atresia, biliary atresiaAbnormal left-right orientations of thoracic and abdominal organs (heterotaxia)Spleen may be present on right side and divided into multiple small piecesPolysplenia can occur alone without other congenital abnormalitiesSplenogonadal fusionAbnormal fusion of splenic and gonadal primordia during prenatal developmentAspleniaRareAssociated with cardiovascular abnormalitiesAnatomyLocated in upper left abdominal cavity, just beneath diaphragm, and posterior to stomachLies against diaphragm in left hypochondriac region at level of 9th and 10th ribsAdjacent to greater curvature of stomach and within omentumSuperior to left colic flexureAnterior to left kidneyDeep to stomach fundusGrossMacroscopic AnatomyBean-shaped organ surrounded by fibrous capsule that extends inward to divide organ into lobulesRoughly triangular in cross sectionSimilar to lymph node in shape and structure but much largerDark red to blue-black in colorConsists of 2 types of tissueWhite pulpNumerous small nodules (1-2 mm) of lymphoid tissueRed pulpVenous sinuses filled with blood and cords of lymphatic cells (e.g., lymphocytes and macrophages)Blood supply via splenic arterySplenic artery enters at hilum and branches in spleenSpleen weight can be important in evaluationTypically 150-200 gVaries with sex, age, height, and weightSize and weight may show considerable variation related to amount of bloodSplenic hilumEntry point for splenic vessels and nervesExit point for efferent lymphaticsAttachment point for gastrosplenic ligamentLocated at L1 vertebral level along transpyloric planeRelation to peritoneumLies within 2 leaflets of dorsal mesenteryCompletely enclosed by peritoneum except at hilumSmall fragments of spleen may be present following trauma (splenosis)MicroscopicCapsuleFibroelastic capsule surrounded by peritoneum, except at hilumTrabeculaeConnective tissue extensions of capsule into parenchyma that carry arterial and venous branchesSplenic VasculatureBlood enters spleen via splenic artery, which then branches into trabecular arteriesSplenic cuffBranching trabeculae composed of dense connective tissueSurrounds branching arteries, veins, and lymphaticsTrabecular arteriesEmerge from connective tissue and become arterioles of white pulp (central arterioles), which are surrounded by periarteriolar lymphatic sheathCentral arteriolesContinue into follicles (follicular arterioles)Follicular arteriolesBecome smaller and terminate in marginal zone or form vascular tuft of capillaries in red pulpArteries, arterioles, and capillaries are lined by endothelial cellsCapillaries in red pulp end as sheathed capillariesSheathed capillariesLack direct communication to sinusesLined by concentrically arranged macrophages and reticular fibers that become continuous with reticular network (stroma) of red pulp (cords)Red cells enter adjacent sinuses via sheathed capillaries and cordsIn conjunction with cords, function as filtering unit of spleenSpleen lacks afferent lymphatic vesselsMay at least partially explain low frequency of epithelial-derived metastasis to spleenRed PulpLoose reticular network of capillaries, penetrating venous sinuses, and cordsVenous sinuses collect blood and are lined by discontinuous layer of cuboidal littoral cellsLittoral cell: Type of endothelial cell that stains with both histiocytic and some, but not all, endothelial markersSplenic cords (cords of Billroth) represent tissue between venous sinusesContain reticular cells, macrophages, and plasma cellsPerifollicular

injuries are also treated in nontrauma centersRisk factorsSeverity of splenic injury increases with presence of preexisting diseases that cause splenomegalyHematologic neoplasms, infectious mononucleosis, malariaPresentationMinor splenic injuryLeft upper quadrant abdominal pain ± left shoulder tendernessLeft shoulder tenderness is due to subdiaphragmatic nerve root stimulationSevere splenic injury with free intraabdominal bloodDiffuse abdominal pain due to peritoneal irritationRebound tenderness may be presentManifestations of early shocke.g., tachycardia, tachypnea, restlessness, and anxietyAbdominal distention and overt shock following significant blood lossAmerican Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) grading of splenic injuries (2018 revised)Grade ISubcapsular hematoma, < 10% of surface areaParenchymal laceration, < 1 cm in depthCapsular tearGrade IISubcapsular hematoma, 10-50% of surface areaIntraparenchymal hematoma, < 5 cm in

VAny injury in presence of splenic vascular injury with active bleeding extending beyond spleen into peritoneumCompletely shattered spleen\nTreatmentOperative management of injured spleenSurgical intervention is indicated in patients who are hemodynamically unstable or have ongoing blood lossCritical to attempt to salvage spleen in patients who require surgeryMild splenic injuries can be managed with electrocautery or absorbable sutureHemisplenectomy may be required in selected casesRapid splenectomy is required in patients with active splenic bleeding and severe splenic injuryShattered or avulsed spleen needs complete removalNonoperative management of injured spleenStandard of care in hemodynamically stable patientsHigh success rate in children with blunt splenic injuriesLower rates of success in adultsAngiography and transcatheter embolizationUseful adjunct to nonoperative management May increase splenic salvage rate in selected patientsMajor complications include missed injuries, delayed bleeding, and splenic abscess\nPrognosisOverall mortality rate from splenic injury is ~ 6-7%Mortality is typically due to associated injuries and not directly due to splenic injury itselfComplications following surgical removal of injured spleenPostsplenectomy sepsisIncreased risk of infection for lifeAsplenic patients should be vaccinated against pneumococcal, meningococcal, and Haemophilus influenzae type B organismsYearly immunization against influenza virusesRare, long-term complication of ruptured spleen Splenosis due to autotransplantation of splenic fragments in various anatomic sitesOccurs following traumatic rupture of spleenLess commonly, may also occur after splenic surgeryMay be incidentally discovered many years after traumatic or iatrogenic rupture of spleenAbdominal and pelvic cavities, most common sitesCan also occur in thoracic cavityRarely reported in unusual locations (e.g., subcutaneous, intrahepatic, and CNS sites)Can mimic primary or metastatic malignancies and create diagnostic problemsIn contrast to accessory spleenSplenosis are typically multiple in numbersBlood supply is from adjacent tissue and not from splenic arteryDifferent histologic features from functional accessory spleensNo hilumCapsule and fibrous trabeculae lack muscle and elastic tissueWhite pulp is poorly formed or absentRed pulp is

extension to hilar vesselsExamine vasculature in splenic hilar regionExamine subcapsular hematomaMeasure surface area involved by hematomaRecord whether hematoma is intact or rupturedSlice spleen at 4- to 5-mm intervalsWash and examine each slice for gross abnormalitiesMeasure and record intraparenchymal hematomasExamine cut surface for incidental findingsRepresentative sections to be

depend on size of infarctSmall infarcts are often clinically silentLarge infarcts present with left-sided upper abdominal painIf diaphragmatic peritoneum becomes inflamed, pain may radiate to left shoulder tip or cause pleuritic chest painInfarcts due to embolic etiologies are commonly associated with feverLeukocytosis and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels are commonSplenic rupture may

suspectedMACROSCOPICSize and WeightVariable based on size of infarct and underlying etiologySmall infarcts may not affect overall organ weight or sizeMassive infarcts result in extensive scarring, decreased size, and functional hyposplenism (e.g., sickle cell disease)Multifocal infarction as result of certain disease states may present as splenomegaly due to underlying disease (e.g., myeloproliferative neoplasms, chronic congestion)Infarct MorphologyTypically wedge-shaped with occluded artery at infarct apex and capsule forming baseInfarct volume increases according to vascular distributionInfarct extends toward periphery, often involving capsuleCapsule may show fibrinopurulent exudateDepending on etiology, infarcted area may be solitary or multiple, or may involve entire spleenAlthough uncommon, parenchymal disruption in extensive lesions may be great enough to result in ruptureTemporal Evolution of InfarctGross appearance of infarct depends on length of time between ischemic event and splenectomyDays 1-3 post infarctionInfarct pale compared to adjacent parenchymaLesional boundaries gradually become more distinctDays 3-7 post infarctionAffected tissue appears tan
