malignant bone tumorChange in Patient ManagementReactive lesions may be followed clinically or excisedBenign neoplasms are often excised or curetted without the need to document negative marginsLow-grade malignancies are resected, often widely (if possible) and with margin assessmentComplete curettage may also be attempted in some well-localized tumorsHigh-grade malignancies may be treated with radiation/chemotherapy prior to resection or resected before treatmentPositive bony &/or marrow margins may generate additional resection or possibly closure and subsequent adjuvant therapyImaging with MR can accurately predict the extent of tumorIf adequate surgical margins are planned based on the imaging appearance, the likelihood of a positive pathologic margin is lowClinical SettingPatient age ranges from pediatric to adultLytic &/or blastic lesions are identified by radiographyMay be incidentally discovered on plain film during evaluation for other conditionsBone destruction &/or soft tissue invasion are often apparent in locally aggressive &/or malignant tumorsMalignancies are more likely than benign lesions to cause painSPECIMEN EVALUATIONRadiographReview of appropriate patient radiographs or radiologic reports prior to receipt of a specimen is highly recommendedThe radiologist's differential diagnosis is essential for correlation with pathologic findingsOften identifies whether or not the lesion is growing aggressivelyKnowing the specific bone and the anatomic region of bone involved is diagnostically useful informationThe identification of an aggressive growth pattern radiographically can be essential in classifying low-grade bone malignancies intraoperativelyGrossDiagnostic bone specimens are almost invariably composed of small fragments of soft tissue and boneMargins sent for bone tumors are either peripheral soft tissue margins or intramedullary marrow marginsFrozen SectionSeparate hard bony fragments from soft tissue fragmentsSofter bony fragments can be frozen, but harder bone may damage the cryostat blade &/or distort a frozen sectionTissue that can be cut easily with a scalpel blade can generally be sectioned on a cryostatAll tissue should be frozen unless the entire lesion has been curetted and sent to pathologyIf completely curetted, representative tissue from specimen usually sufficesThese specimens are usually from presumptively benign lesionsCytologyA marrow curettage sample may be provided to evaluate bone marginsThe sample is spread on a glass slide as a cytology specimenTouch prep slides of lesional tissue may be helpful if metastatic carcinoma is suspectedMOST COMMON DIAGNOSESMetastasisFar more common than primary bone tumorsCarcinoma is most common, but melanoma, sarcoma, or lymphoma may also spread to boneMust always be considered in patients > 45 years oldPatients often have a history of cancer elsewhere as well as prior metastatic disease (e.g., to lymph nodes, lung)Any bone may be involvedMost often proximal humerus, proximal femur, or spineHistologic appearance depends on primary tumorUsually adenocarcinoma (most common primary sites include breast, lung, kidney, prostate, liver, and thyroid)Some metastatic carcinomas (particularly from prostate) are osteoblastic and produce focal to abundant woven boneAmount of tumor present may be relatively limited compared to the size of the lytic lesionMetastases can stimulate osteoclasts to resorb boneMultiple sections may need to be examined to identify metastatic cellsImmunohistochemical studies performed on permanent sections may be necessary for classification if no primary site is knownDecalcification can diminish immunoreactivity for some antigensIf possible, softer areas of tumor should be separated and not decalcifiedOsteosarcomaMost commonly presents as severe pain in young patients 10-20 years old2nd peak occurs in patients > 50 years old who have a predisposing condition (e.g., radiation, Paget disease)Most common malignant bone tumor (20%)Imaging often shows a large permeative and destructive lesion in metaphysis/diaphysis of long bone, most commonly around the region of the knee (~ 50% of cases)Most cases show sheets of frankly malignant cells with high level of mitotic activityDiagnosis depends on identification of pink seams of osteoid or immature bone directly produced by malignant cellsSome tumors may show focal or prominent cartilaginous differentiation, leading to possible confusion with chondrosarcomaYounger age and presence of cellular sheets of malignant cells (± osteoid) favor osteosarcomaOther variant morphologies include fibroblastic (spindled), small cell, clear cell, telangiectatic, and giant cell richEnchondromaOften painless unless associated with fractureImaging often shows a small, well-circumscribed lesion without locally aggressive features in diaphysis/metaphysis of long bonesIn long bones: Generally composed of fragments and nodules of bland hyaline cartilage, often with thin, pink seam of peripheral boneChondrocyte cellularity is often low and with minimal or no nuclear atypiaIn small bones of hands and feet: Often much more cellular and may demonstrate mild nuclear atypia and myxoid matrix degenerationClinical and radiologic correlation to evaluate for pathologic cortical bone disruption and soft tissue extension is most helpful in excluding chondrosarcomaIn some cases, it can be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to histologically distinguish enchondroma from low-grade chondrosarcomaCorrelation with imaging is often critical in making this distinctionIn ambiguous cases, a diagnosis of \"low-grade cartilaginous lesion, final diagnosis deferred to permanent sections\" is appropriateAny subsequent curetted tissue should be submitted for permanent histologic evaluationChondrosarcomaOften painfulThe majority of patients are > 50 years oldImaging generally shows irregular, large, and destructive tumor, often with cortical disruption and soft tissue extension, involving metaphysis/diaphysis of long bonesClear cell chondrosarcoma (variant) characteristically arises in epiphysis of long bonesCellularity and chondrocyte nuclear atypia vary widely, depending on grade, but most cases show a higher degree of both than is seen in benign cartilage or enchondromaChondrocyte necrosis and prominent matrix degeneration are also more common in chondrosarcomaIn some cases, a definitive diagnosis of a low-grade lesion will not be possible on frozen sectionChondrosarcoma of small bones of the hands and feet is very rare and requires evidence of true bony or soft tissue invasion for diagnosisDedifferentiated chondrosarcoma may show cellular, noncartilaginous high-grade sarcoma or neoplastic cartilage or both, depending on what portion of tumor is sampled at time of frozen sectionEwing SarcomaMost common in patients < 20 years old (80% of cases)Painful, enlarging mass, often with soft tissue swellingImaging shows large, poorly defined, destructive tumor most often centered in metaphysis or diaphysis of long bones or flat bones of pelvisThis is a type of small round blue cell tumor consisting of sheets of monomorphic small round cells with scanty cytoplasm within variably fibrous backgroundMost cells have finely distributed chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoliNecrosis is often abundantDiagnosis of \"malignant small round blue cell tumor, final diagnosis deferred to permanent sections\" is often appropriateMust exclude other morphologically similar neoplasms, such as small cell osteosarcoma, mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, or lymphomaConfirmatory ancillary testing (IHC, FISH, etc.) is required on permanent sectionsGiant Cell TumorTypically occur in adults (age range: 25-45 years old)Localization to epiphysis of long bone is characteristic, similar to chondroblastoma and clear cell chondrosarcomaAlso shows metaphyseal extension in many casesTumor is often locally aggressive and may show limited soft tissue extensionComposed of sheets of multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells in background of bland, monomorphic ovoid, or spindled stromal cellsGiant cells may be very large (> 50 nuclei)Stromal cells should not show malignant cytologic features or atypical mitosesEvidence of frank malignancy should raise possibility of other tumors, such as metastatic carcinoma, osteosarcoma, dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma, etc.May contain areas of aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC)Epiphyseal location suggests secondary ABC over primary ABCChondroblastomaTypically occurs in skeletally immature patients with open growth plates (age range: 10-25 years old)Localization to epiphysis or apophysis of long bone is characteristicImaging shows a well-defined tumor of variable size, often with sclerotic marginsContains large number of osteoclast-like giant cells, similar to giant cell tumorPredominant cell type (chondroblast) is generally pink, epithelioid, and with a nucleus that is sometimes groovedIdentification of stromal chicken-wire calcification and fragments of cartilage is commonChondroblastoma can be distinguished from giant cell tumorYoung age, epithelioid \"fried-egg\" cells with grooved nuclei, chicken-wire calcification, and presence of cartilage all favor chondroblastomaMay contain areas of ABCFibrous DysplasiaMost common in young to middle-aged patients; often asymptomaticMay present as solitary or multiple lesions (either within same or different bones)Most common in long bonesOther sites (e.g., ribs and craniofacial bones) may be involvedImaging shows well-circumscribed intramedullary tumor, most commonly in diaphysis and metadiaphysisComposed of mixture of fibroblasts and immature (woven) bone trabeculaeSpindled fibroblasts are bland and may demonstrate storiform growth patternStroma is often collagenous but may be myxoidWoven bone trabeculae are characteristically irregularly shaped, discontinuous, and often lack osteoblastic rimmingWoven bone production can be focal in some tumors and may not be sampled, potentially leading to diagnostic difficultyDoes not demonstrate infiltrative or permeative growth pattern through preexisting lamellar bone (this finding suggests low-grade osteosarcoma)Aneurysmal Bone CystMost commonly arises in young patients (< 20 years old) in metaphyseal region of long bonesImaging generally shows expansile, lytic, and cystic lesion, often with fluid levels due to bloodComposed of variably thick cyst walls containing bland, spindled to ovoid cells, scattered giant cells, and focal seams of osteoidFrankly malignant cells are inconsistent with diagnosis and may suggest telangiectatic osteosarcomaEpiphyseal lesions with the appearance of an ABC are usually different tumors (giant cell tumor, chondroblastoma, etc.) with a secondary ABCOsteomyelitisPatients often complain of pain and systemic symptomsCan easily mimic neoplasm on imagingEarly osteomyelitis shows fragments of mature lamellar bone associated with granulation tissue, necrotic bone, and collections of acute inflammatory cellsChronic osteomyelitis often shows intertrabecular loose fibrosis and more prominent plasma cell infiltrateFibrous dysplasia and low-grade osteosarcoma show cellular spindle cell proliferation rather than loose fibrosisPlasma cell neoplasms contain sheets of plasma cells and lack granulation tissueLangerhans Cell Histiocytosis (Eosinophilic Granuloma)Usually presents in first 3 decades of lifeMay be solitary (eosinophilic granuloma) or multifocalSystemic disease involves multiple organ systems and frequently occurs in first 2 years of lifeMost common in craniofacial bones but can involve any boneImaging usually shows small, well-defined lesion (may have punched-out appearance)Composed of irregular sheets and nests of pink histiocytic cells (Langerhans cells) within typically prominent mixed chronic inflammatory infiltrateLangerhans cell nuclei are generally ovoid with nuclear grooves (coffee bean-shaped) or notchedEosinophils are variably prominent and may show eosinophilic abscess formationReactive germinal centers may be presentInflammation may be prominent and obscure diagnostic Langerhans cellsMetaphyseal Fibrous Defect (Nonossifying Fibroma/Fibrous Cortical Defect)Most common in 2nd decade of lifeImaging shows small, well-demarcated, cortical-based lesion in metaphysis of long bonePainless and asymptomatic unless large or associated with fractureComposed of bland, spindled fibroblasts in storiform growth pattern associated with scattered multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cellsNumber of giant cells may be striking, but sheets of giant cells are not seen (as in giant cell tumor)Xanthomatous change and chronic inflammation are commonly identifiedPlasma Cell NeoplasmIncludes solitary plasmacytoma, multiple myeloma, and lymphomas with plasmacytic/plasmablastic differentiationVery common primary malignant bone tumorsMost patients are middle aged or olderMay present as localized lesion (plasmacytoma) or as component of widespread disease (plasma cell myeloma)Composed of sheets of plasma cells demonstrating varying degrees of nuclear atypiaPoorly differentiated plasma cells may be difficult to distinguish from carcinoma, and clinical/radiographic correlation or even deferral may be requiredTouch preps may be helpful in evaluation of cellsLymphomaMost commonly represents involvement of bone by systemic disease, although primary lymphomas of bone rarely occurUsually occurs in adults, but age range is wideImaging shows large, destructive mass often centered in metadiaphysis of long boneMay extend to form soft tissue massHistologic appearance depends on type of lymphoma, but most form dyscohesive sheets of variably monomorphic round cells and would be classified as small round blue cell tumorsWell-formed cohesive nests and aggregates are not generally seen as in carcinomaEvaluation may be hindered by extensive crush artifact or necrosis, and more tissue should be requested for evaluation in this situationDiagnosis of

giant cells with no malignant stromal cell atypiaLow-Grade Chondrosarcoma vs. EnchondromaCan be extremely difficult if not impossible to distinguish histologicallyClinical behavior and radiographs are critical in helping make distinctionCortical erosion/destruction &/or soft tissue extension support chondrosarcomaEnchondroma is typically small, well localized, and more likely to be found incidentallyDiagnosis of \"low-grade cartilaginous neoplasm, final diagnosis deferred to permanent sections\" is acceptable in cases with little to no supportive clinicoradiologic informationMisinterpreting Fracture Callus as MalignancyIdentification of fracture in patients > 45 years old should prompt careful search for metastatic carcinomaPathologic fracture can coexist in benign or malignant lesionsFracture is often known or suspected clinicallyPreexisting history of trauma to area is often availableFracture callus is composed of hypercellular cartilage admixed with woven bone formation and fibroconnective tissue, often in relatively linear array (along original fracture line)Hypercellular cartilage may raise possibility of chondrosarcoma, but overall context essentially precludes that diagnosisExuberant fracture callus may clinically simulate (rare) true bone neoplasm due to apparent bony expansionSmall Focus of Metastatic Carcinoma Not SeenA high level of suspicion for metastatic carcinoma must be maintained in any patient > 45 years oldThis is particularly important for patients with a history of carcinomaOften, a component of reactive stromal myofibroblastic proliferation is associated with metastasisIts sole presence may indicate that additional sections should be cut in case diagnostic tissue is focalAll remaining tissue should be submitted for frozen section evaluation if metastatic disease is suspected and initial evaluation is negativeMetastatic carcinomas can produce osteolytic factorsRadiologic lesion can be considerably larger than actual carcinomaBiopsy Not Representative of LesionNot uncommonReactive soft tissue overlying bone may be unintentionally sampled instead of true lesionWhat appears to be chronic osteomyelitis may actually be adjacent reactive and inflamed fibroblastic tissue overlying true neoplasmClinical and imaging findings help guide interpretation",

surgery (BCS)Change in Patient ManagementIf a positive margin for invasive carcinoma or a close margin (< 0.2 cm) for DCIS is identified, additional tissue will be removedClinical SettingFor BCS, the contemporary 10-year local recurrence rate ranges from 5-10%A positive margin is associated with a 2x increase in the risk of local recurrenceFor invasive carcinoma, consensus guidelines define negative margins as no ink on invasive carcinoma or DCISFor cases of DCIS only, an adequate margin is defined as ≥ 2 mmThe biologic subtype of carcinoma influences local recurrenceLow-grade ER-positive cancers rarely recur locally when treated with hormonal therapyHigh-grade ER-negative cancers often recur locally, even after mastectomyThe majority of invasive carcinomas can be palpated by the surgeon and are easily completely resectedEvaluation of margins for invasive carcinoma can generally be performed by gross examinationGross margins cannot be reliably assessed for diffusely infiltrative carcinomas (e.g., lobular carcinoma) and carcinomas treated with neoadjuvant therapy with a response to treatmentDCIS is the most frequent cause of close or positive marginsUsually not grossly evidentMargin involvement can be very focalDiagnosis by frozen section can be very difficultMay be in fatty tissue that does not freeze well, and technically adequate sections may be difficult to produceCan be difficult to distinguish from usual hyperplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia, and lobular carcinoma in situ on frozen sectionEvaluating the entire surface of specimens by frozen section is generally not practical in time allotted for breast surgeryIn some BCS, additional shave margins are taken after the main excision is removedThis reduces some sources of false-positive margins, such as ink leakage into tissue cracksThe orientation of each margin is clearer to both the surgeon and the pathologist as compared to the pathologist inking a specimen based on suture orientationThe incidence of positive/close margins is reduced, and some surgeons do not request intraoperative evaluationThe need for reexcision for some women continues to be a concernReexcision rates for invasive carcinoma in the USA range from ~ 10-20%Reexcision rates for DCIS in the USA range from ~ 35-40%ALTERNATIVE METHODS TO FROZEN SECTIONDue to the continuing goal to achieve adequate margins in 1 BCS, many techniques are being developed that allow the surgeon to distinguish carcinoma from normal tissue in the operating roomMarginProbe (Dion Technologies) is currently the only one approved by the Food and Drug AdministrationThe device uses radiofrequency spectroscopy to distinguish benign from malignant tissueMalignant tissue has different electrical properties compared to normal tissue due to differences in ion concentration, ion mobility, metabolism, water content, and cellular structureHowever, some benign lesions can have similar propertiesThe surgeon scans the surface of the excised specimen using a probe with a 0.7-cm discMalignant tissue is detected to a 0.1-cm depthA positive (malignant) or negative signal is received within 1-5 seconds~ 5 minutes are required to assess an entire specimenIf a positive signal is received, the surgeon removes a shave margin in this areaIn order to maximize sensitivity to detect all cancers, specificity is lower, resulting in a false-positive rate of ~ 30-50%This may lead to removing more tissue than necessaryIn multiple studies, the use of the device decreased the need for reexcision when the initial rate was highThe utility in centers with initially low reexcision rates is questionedThe reported cost is also a concern: Reported to be ~ $20,000 USD for the device and ~ $1,000 USD for the probe used in each operationSPECIMEN EVALUATIONGrossFor excisions localized with a device, the specimen radiograph should be available to the pathologistLesions present are identified: Masses, calcifications, clips, localization devicesThe relationship of lesions to the 4 margins present on the radiograph can be determinedIn some institutions, a 2nd radiograph may be taken to identify the remaining 2 marginsThe specimen is oriented to identify 6 marginsThe surgeon should identify any margins that cannot undergo reexcision (e.g., skin or muscle fascia)Inks can be used to identify margins if frozen section is to be performedIf cytology preparations are planned, specimen is not inkedThe specimen is serially sectioned (2-3 mm)Gross lesions are correlated with radiologic findingsThe distance of invasive carcinomas to margins is recordedAreas suspicious for margin involvement are identifiedFor shave excisions, the surgeon must identify the new (true) marginThe new margin is inked, and the specimen is sectioned perpendicular to the marginAny gross lesions are identifiedFrozen SectionThe most suspicious area(s) for involvement by carcinoma are taken as small perpendicular sectionsAreas of adipose tissue should be avoided as tissue will not freeze wellEn face sections are not recommended as distance of carcinoma to margin cannot be assessedCytologyScrape preparations can be taken from the 6

researchChange in Patient ManagementIf the specimen is nondiagnostic or inconclusive, additional tissue should be requestedMargins are rarely assessedThe neurosurgeon may submit samples to assess whether adjacent tissue is normalIn nonneoplastic conditions, a specific diagnosis often cannot be determined on frozen sectionSufficient tissue should be obtained for ancillary studies for eventual diagnosis on permanent sectionsClinical SettingPatients presenting with a change in neurologic status, inconclusive imaging studies, or a focal lesion require diagnosisPatients with new neurologic symptoms often require tissue samplingThe presentation may be acute or insidiousNew onset of seizures or focal deficits (e.g., hemiparesis, language difficulty, visual field cuts)Signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (headache, nausea/vomiting, impaired consciousness, new cranial nerve deficits)Patients with a known systemic disease and suspected brain involvement require diagnosisPrimary systemic malignancy with suspicion for CNS involvementImmunocompromised patients (e.g., HIV/AIDS, organ transplant) at risk for opportunistic infectionPatients with a clinical suspicion for some types of diseases require tissue sampling for ancillary studies but do not require intraoperative diagnosisDementing illness, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseaseIntraoperative

and the duration of the diseaseNeuroanatomic localization and signal characteristics impact differential diagnosisMass effect, cystic/solid nature, presence of hydrocephalus, thinning of overlying bone, and loss of cerebral parenchymal volume are all importantClinical PresentationThe combination of imaging features and clinical presentation can narrow the differential diagnosis and help to determine whether the sample is representative of the disease or whether additional samples should be requestedThe pathologist uses this information to determine if a specimen is sufficient for diagnosisExamplesDiagnostic sample: Highly cellular neoplasm in a patient who presents with a centrally necrotic cerebral tumorNondiagnostic sample: Rare atypical cells in a patient who presents with a centrally necrotic cerebral tumorGrossThere are usually very few distinctive macroscopic characteristicsGliomas: Gray-translucent, soft, gelatinous textureMetastatic carcinoma: Red or tan, gritty consistencyAbscesses: Purulent, sometimes with fibrous wallLesional tissue needs to be distinguished from normalNormal cortex: Gray, soft consistencyNormal white matter: Chalky white, homogeneous, soft consistencyFrozen SectionIt is important to not use the entire specimen as additional tissue may not be available for other studiesA minute portion of the specimen is taken for cytologic preparationIf a core biopsy is provided, a small fragment from each end of the core is usedIf a large specimen is provided, several small fragments should be reserved for smear preparationFrozen section methodTissue to be frozen is perched on a small bead of embedding medium but not covered with mediumTissue is frozen quickly with a light touch of a metal heat extractor or cryospray to avoid

suspected infection, or specimens with calcificationsCytologic PreparationsSmear method1- to 3-pinhead-sized fragments are placed 1/3 of the way down on the glass slideIn general, the smaller the fragment, the better the smearA 2nd slide is used to firmly but evenly smear tissue on the slide, which is then immediately fixed in 95% ethanol, and stained with H&ESlides should be held above a fixative container to avoid any delay in fixationAir drying distorts cytology and can generate misleading artifactsInsufficient force will lead to obscured, overlapping regions, while excessive force will cause streaking, which will distort cytomorphologySmear characteristics: The perceived consistency of the tissue between glass slides while making the smear can be very informative as to the nature of the lesionSchwannomas and fibroblastic meningiomas are firm and difficult to smearCrunching \"sand\" between glass suggests calcificationsSoft, highly cellular tumors, such as pituitary adenomas, smear easily in single cell layerAfter staining, the slide is inspected to identify how evenly tissue has been smearedTouch preparation methodUse for firm/calcified/fibrous lesionsTissue is

DIAGNOSESDiffusely Infiltrating GliomasDiffusely infiltrating gliomas are a heterogeneous group of increasingly molecularly defined tumors, which cannot be reliably distinguished by morphology aloneHigh-grade histologic features overlap across all tumor types and include increased mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation/endothelial cell hyperplasia, and spontaneous necrosis (especially in a palisading pattern)Adult infiltrating gliomas are divided into 3 major molecularly defined categories: IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, IDH-mutant astrocytoma, and IDH-mutant oligodendrogliomaPediatric and young adult diffuse gliomas are uncommon and divided into a low-grade group and a high-grade group, defined by molecular alterations &/or the presence of high-grade histologic featuresPediatric low-grade gliomas most commonly harbor MAPK pathway gene alterations [polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumor of the young (PLNTY), diffuse low-grade glioma MAPK pathway-altered], or MYB/MYBL1 rearrangements (angiocentric glioma, diffuse astrocytoma MYB/MYBL1-altered)Pediatric diffuse high-grade gliomas harbor histone 3 subunit mutations (diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27-altered, diffuse hemispheric glioma, H3 G34-mutant), activating RTK gene fusions (infant-type hemispheric glioma), or high-grade histology without histone 3 subunit or IDH mutation (diffuse pediatric-type high-grade glioma, H3-wildtype and IDH-wildtype)Glioblastoma, CNS WHO grade 4 (IDH wildtype)Lacks IDH mutation; diagnosis may be rendered by the presence of high-grade histologic features or molecular featuresEGFR amplification, TERT promoter mutation, or concurrent polysomy 7 and monosomy 10 are molecular criteria for glioblastoma in IDH-wildtype infiltrating gliomaMR findings: Typically show ring enhancement with a central core of necrosis; may cross corpus callosum (\"butterfly\")Frozen sectionHypercellularity and infiltrative growth around normal brain structures are best seen on frozen sectionSpontaneous necrosis, especially palisading necrosis &/or glomeruloid microvascular proliferationMicrovascular thrombi are a strong predictor of IDH-wildtype

commonly encounteredGlioblastomas with sarcomatoid differentiation may smear poorlyMarked variability in tumor morphology, both between and within tumorsAstrocytoma, IDH mutant, CNS WHO grades 2-4Defined molecularly by the presence of activating IDH1 or IDH2 mutation without concurrent chromosomal arm 1p19q codeletionMR findings: Hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2, with relative FLAIR hypointensity, typically nonenhancing; enhancement suggests a high-grade componentEnriched for frontal lobe locationsIncreased mitotic activity indicates grade 3, while necrosis, microvascular proliferation, or homozygous deletion of CDKN2A indicates grade 4Frozen sectionOften edematous or with abundant mucinous microcysts, leading to significant freezing artifactLower grade tumors often show only a mild increase in cellularity relative to normal brainFine calcifications may be seen on occasionSmearCytology is often bland and may resemble a normal brain with only rare cells with mild cytologic atypiaSignificant morphologic overlap with oligodendroglioma, often with less rounded nuclei and more prominent fine glial processesGemistocytic cytomorphology, when present, may be helpful in confirming tumor but should be carefully distinguished from reactive astrogliosisSpecimens are often inconclusive intraoperatively and may be reported descriptively (e.g., \"mildly hypercellular cellular brain parenchyma, suspicious for glioma\")Oligodendroglioma, CNS WHO grades 2-3 (IDH mutant)Oligodendrogliomas are molecularly defined by the presence of pathogenic IDH1 or IDH2 mutation with concurrent chromosomal arm 1p19q codeletionMR findings: Hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2; enhancement suggests high-grade featuresCriteria for WHO grade 3 (formerly anaplastic) oligodendroglioma

imperceptible cytoplasmIn contrast to other glial tumors, tumor cells do not usually show fibrillary processes but may arise in a background of astrogliosisMay be difficult to distinguish from other low-grade infiltrating gliomas but not necessary at time of frozen sectionPitfallsSamples taken too superficially may show minimal invasion of brain by tumor, while samples taken from too deep in high-grade lesions may demonstrate necrosis without viable cellsEpithelioid glioblastomas may be difficult to distinguish from carcinomas; acceptable to report as \"malignant epithelioid neoplasm\" as surgical management is similarSmall cell glioblastomas may be difficult to distinguish from lymphomasDue to the difference in management, concern for lymphoma should be discussed with the surgeon, and flow cytometry may be consideredDemyelinating disease is a notorious mimic for glioblastoma, both by imaging and histology; the presence of abundant, foamy macrophages should raise concern for demyelination rather than gliomaDemyelinating disease may demonstrate marked reactive-type atypia, and delicate mitotic figures (\"Creutzfeldt cells\") may be counteredReportingDistinguishing molecular-defined entities is not possible at frozen sectionTumors without high-grade features should be reported as \"glioma, no high-grade features seen\" due to the potential for heterogeneity in

              "MOST COMMON DIAGNOSES": "Diffusely Infiltrating GliomasDiffusely infiltrating gliomas are a heterogeneous group of increasingly molecularly defined tumors, which cannot be reliably distinguished by morphology aloneHigh-grade histologic features overlap across all tumor types and include increased mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation/endothelial cell hyperplasia, and spontaneous necrosis (especially in a palisading pattern)Adult infiltrating gliomas are divided into 3 major molecularly defined categories: IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, IDH-mutant astrocytoma, and IDH-mutant oligodendrogliomaPediatric and young adult diffuse gliomas are uncommon and divided into a low-grade group and a high-grade group, defined by molecular alterations &/or the presence of high-grade histologic featuresPediatric low-grade gliomas most commonly harbor MAPK pathway gene alterations [polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumor of the young (PLNTY), diffuse low-grade glioma MAPK pathway-altered], or MYB/MYBL1 rearrangements (angiocentric glioma, diffuse astrocytoma MYB/MYBL1-altered)Pediatric diffuse high-grade gliomas harbor histone 3 subunit mutations (diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27-altered, diffuse hemispheric glioma, H3 G34-mutant), activating RTK gene fusions (infant-type hemispheric glioma), or high-grade histology without histone 3 subunit or IDH mutation (diffuse pediatric-type high-grade glioma, H3-wildtype and IDH-wildtype)Glioblastoma, CNS WHO grade 4 (IDH wildtype)Lacks IDH mutation; diagnosis may be rendered by the presence of high-grade histologic features or molecular featuresEGFR amplification, TERT promoter mutation, or concurrent polysomy 7 and monosomy 10 are molecular criteria for glioblastoma in IDH-wildtype infiltrating gliomaMR findings: Typically show ring enhancement with a central core of necrosis; may cross corpus callosum (\"butterfly\")Frozen sectionHypercellularity and infiltrative growth around normal brain structures are best seen on frozen sectionSpontaneous necrosis, especially palisading necrosis &/or glomeruloid microvascular proliferationMicrovascular thrombi are a strong predictor of IDH-wildtype statusSmearAbundant fibrillary glial cell processesMitotic figures, nuclear atypia, and pleomorphism best seen on smearSpindled, gemistocytic, epithelioid, small cell, and giant cell cytologies are commonly encounteredGlioblastomas with sarcomatoid differentiation may smear poorlyMarked variability in tumor morphology, both between and within tumorsAstrocytoma, IDH mutant, CNS WHO grades 2-4Defined molecularly by the presence of activating IDH1 or IDH2 mutation without concurrent chromosomal arm 1p19q codeletionMR findings: Hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2, with relative FLAIR hypointensity, typically nonenhancing; enhancement suggests a high-grade componentEnriched for frontal lobe locationsIncreased mitotic activity indicates grade 3, while necrosis, microvascular proliferation, or homozygous deletion of CDKN2A indicates grade 4Frozen sectionOften edematous or with abundant mucinous microcysts, leading to significant freezing artifactLower grade tumors often show only a mild increase in cellularity relative to normal brainFine calcifications may be seen on occasionSmearCytology is often bland and may resemble a normal brain with only rare cells with mild cytologic atypiaSignificant morphologic overlap with oligodendroglioma, often with less rounded nuclei and more prominent fine glial processesGemistocytic cytomorphology, when present, may be helpful in confirming tumor but should be carefully distinguished from reactive astrogliosisSpecimens are often inconclusive intraoperatively and may be reported descriptively (e.g., \"mildly hypercellular cellular brain parenchyma, suspicious for glioma\")Oligodendroglioma, CNS WHO grades 2-3 (IDH mutant)Oligodendrogliomas are molecularly defined by the presence of pathogenic IDH1 or IDH2 mutation with concurrent chromosomal arm 1p19q codeletionMR findings: Hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2; enhancement suggests high-grade featuresCriteria for WHO grade 3 (formerly anaplastic) oligodendroglioma

imperceptible cytoplasmIn contrast to other glial tumors, tumor cells do not usually show fibrillary processes but may arise in a background of astrogliosisMay be difficult to distinguish from other low-grade infiltrating gliomas but not necessary at time of frozen sectionPitfallsSamples taken too superficially may show minimal invasion of brain by tumor, while samples taken from too deep in high-grade lesions may demonstrate necrosis without viable cellsEpithelioid glioblastomas may be difficult to distinguish from carcinomas; acceptable to report as \"malignant epithelioid neoplasm\" as surgical management is similarSmall cell glioblastomas may be difficult to distinguish from lymphomasDue to the difference in management, concern for lymphoma should be discussed with the surgeon, and flow cytometry may be consideredDemyelinating disease is a notorious mimic for glioblastoma, both by imaging and histology; the presence of abundant, foamy macrophages should raise concern for demyelination rather than gliomaDemyelinating disease may demonstrate marked reactive-type atypia, and delicate mitotic figures (\"Creutzfeldt cells\") may be counteredReportingDistinguishing

ganglioglioma: Firm and chalky-white or tan with loss of gray-white matter junctionInfiltrating glioma: Tan, ill-defined mass with blurring of gray matter-white matter junctionCortical lesions: Can show polymicrogyria or pachygyriaResections can be large, including entire temporal lobe and hippocampusCortical specimens should be oriented, if possible, and cut thinly perpendicular to cortical surface to evaluate thickness of cortex, gray matter-white matter junction, and characteristics of white matterHippocampus, if taken en bloc, can be oriented along the long axis and cut perpendicular to the long axisAmygdala is usually fragmented and cannot be properly orientedMany seizure-associated lesions can be calcifiedDecalcification should be avoided as it has deleterious effects on the

close to the stapled margin as possibleThe tissue closest to the margin should be evaluatedThe proximal and distal margins are inkedThe tumor should not be cut through (if possible) when opening the esophagusThe location of the tumor can generally be determined by palpating the interior surface of the esophagusThe cancer site is identifiedCancers in the distal esophagus and at the gastroesophageal junction are usually adenocarcinomasOften associated with Barrett esophagusBarrett esophagus consists of metaplastic salmon-pink columnar mucosa interspersed within gray-white squamous mucosaCancers in the stomach are usually adenocarcinomasWide variation in gross appearance: Polypoid fungating masses to ulceroinfiltrative lesionsSignet-ring cell carcinomas may present with diffusely thickened muscularis propria and normal overlying mucosa (\"linitis plastica\")Lesions of the esophageal or gastric wall are usually leiomyomas or gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST)After

terminology of squamous precursor lesions are not standardizedThere are advocates for 2-tiered (low and high grade) and up to 4-tiered systems (mild, moderate, severe dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ)Reproducibility is poor and diminishes with more grading tiersGrading usually based on vertical extent of involvement (e.g., only basal atypia in lower 1/3 considered mild dysplasia, 1/3-2/3 considered moderate dysplasia, > 2/3 severe dysplasia)Dysplasia may be considered of higher grade than dictated by vertical extent of involvement when more pronounced nuclear atypia is presentFor frozen sections, severe dysplasia/carcinoma in situ at margins will usually prompt additional samplingLesser degrees of dysplasia may not require additional tissue according to the surgeon's judgment and clinical circumstances (location, solitary vs. multifocal)Discussion with the surgeon regarding management may be helpful prior to diagnosisDiagnostic features include budding of rete ridges, expansion of basal proliferative layer, migration of mitoses into upper cell layers, nuclear hyperchromasia, nuclear size variation, and dyskeratosisREPORTINGFrozen SectionDiagnosis of carcinoma, when

the presence of adjacent normal tissue to recognize the presence of invasionIrregular nests of tumor cells &/or individual infiltrative cellsUsually readily recognizedVerrucous CarcinomaExtremely well-differentiated variant of SCCInvades as a uniform front of invasion with bulbous rete ridgesMinimal cytologic atypiaWhen strictly defined, the only risk is for local recurrence\nDiagnosis is reserved for excised tumors, as similar features may be seen in areas of conventional SCCBasaloid Squamous Cell CarcinomaBasaloid tumor cells have scant cytoplasm and high-grade features, including necrosis, nuclear hyperchromasia, and frequent mitosesRecognition relies on identification of squamous differentiation (keratinization or intercellular bridges) or coexisting squamous dysplasia/carcinoma in situMust be distinguished from oropharyngeal HPV-associated SCC, which has a favorable prognosisAdditional studies on permanent sections requiredClinical correlation is necessary to exclude extension of an oropharyngeal primary into the oral cavityDifferential diagnosis includes other high-grade small round cell malignancies, especially small cell carcinoma and solid variant adenoid cystic carcinomaDistinction often requires special stainsAdequate on frozen section to diagnose as basaloid carcinoma and defer definitive classificationPapillary Squamous Cell CarcinomaOften associated with high-risk HPVIn small biopsies, invasion may not be obviousOften represents superficial sampling of bulky, clinically evident malignancy so that definitive confirmation of invasion may not be essential on frozen sectionSarcomatoid (Spindle Cell) CarcinomaMalignant spindle cell proliferation coexisting with conventional SCC &/or squamous dysplasiaDifferential diagnosis is with melanoma and sarcoma, especially leiomyosarcomaMay require special stains, but as many as 50% are negative for epithelial markersBehaves similarly to conventional SCCSquamous Dysplasia/Squamous Cell Carcinoma In SituGrading and terminology of squamous precursor lesions are not standardizedThere are advocates for 2-tiered (low and high grade) and up to 4-tiered systems (mild, moderate, severe dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ)Reproducibility is poor and diminishes with more grading tiersGrading usually based on vertical extent of involvement (e.g., only basal atypia in lower 1/3 considered mild dysplasia, 1/3-2/3 considered moderate dysplasia, > 2/3 severe dysplasia)Dysplasia may be considered of higher grade than dictated by vertical extent of involvement when more pronounced nuclear atypia is presentFor frozen sections, severe dysplasia/carcinoma in situ at margins will usually prompt additional samplingLesser degrees of dysplasia may not require additional tissue according to the surgeon's judgment and clinical circumstances (location, solitary vs. multifocal)Discussion with the surgeon regarding management may be helpful prior to diagnosisDiagnostic features include budding of rete ridges, expansion of basal proliferative layer, migration of mitoses into upper cell layers, nuclear hyperchromasia, nuclear size variation, and dyskeratosisREPORTINGFrozen Section\nDiagnosis of carcinoma, when possibleStatus of margin (positive or negative) and distance to marginSpecify if carcinoma or dysplasia (including the grade of dysplasia)Perineural &/or lymphovascular invasionPITFALLSFalse-Negative DiagnosesDeeper levels in frozen section blocks sometimes reveal cancer missed in initial superficial sectionsA deep level into block should be included in the frozen section evaluationDenuded or maloriented blocks may miss dysplasia or make it impossible to assess grade accuratelyDeeper tissue levels should be attempted to resolve diagnostic uncertaintyIf necessary, the block can be turned 90° to the correct orientationSampling error can occur if the entire specimen is not frozenTissue taken may not include a positive marginFalse-Positive DiagnosesPseudoinfiltrative growth due to tangential sectioning can mimic invasionDeeper levels should be obtained to confirm connection to overlying epitheliumDuct involvement by severe dysplasia/carcinoma in situ may mimic invasionUniform distribution, lack of single infiltrative cells, perpendicular orientation to surface epithelium, and connection to surface epithelium aid in recognitionMarked inflammation may cause reactive epithelial atypia and obscure the basement membrane zoneHigher threshold for diagnosis of dysplasia or invasive carcinoma is advisedAdditional levels may be helpfulAtypia after radiation therapy may be difficult to distinguish from dysplasia or infiltrating tumor cellsIsolated nucleomegaly and cytomegaly with vacuolization of either nucleus or cytoplasmNuclear:cytoplasmic ratio is preservedNecrotizing sialometaplasia mimics invasive carcinomaMay occur after prior biopsy, tissue injury, or radiationLobulated squamous metaplasia of salivary ducts without marked atypia aids in recognitionBenign architecture is best appreciated at low powerPseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasiaBland nuclear features of pseudoinfiltrative squamous epitheliumEspecially common with granular cell tumorsEssential to look at stroma for diagnostic epithelioid tumor cells with granular cytoplasmAlso seen with lymphomaCandidiasis may cause squamous hyperplasia and reactive epithelial changes that may be mistaken for dysplasia or, rarely, carcinomaIntraepithelial neutrophils are a clue to the potential presence of fungal organismsIf uncertain about the presence of dysplasia, a diagnosis of squamous atypia may be appropriate with a recommendation to rebiopsy if the lesion persists after treating the infection"

fibrous or ovarian-type stroma or smooth muscleAngiomyolipomaUsually well circumscribed with gross appearance depending on proportion of adipose tissue, smooth muscle, and blood vessels presentImaging findings may be diagnostic due to admixture of adipose tissueIf the smooth muscle component is dominant, the imaging appearance can resemble RCCConsists of varying proportions of dystrophic blood vessels, smooth muscle, and adipose tissueBlood vessels have thick hyalinized walls with spindle cells radiating outward from vascular wallCare must be made not to overdiagnose areas of spindle

epithelial cellsHemorrhage &/or inflammatory changes can make distinction from solid neoplasms difficult by imagingRCC can have extensive necrosis and appear cystic with gross appearance, mimicking hemorrhagic simple cystCysts should be carefully examined for mural nodules or papillary projections, which may be only focally present in a cystic, necrotic RCCPapillary AdenomasBenign, usually incidental lesions; may be multipleAdenomas are nonencapsulated neoplasms < 15 mm in size with papillary &/or tubular architecture and low-grade nucleiMay be difficult to distinguish from low-grade

Cell CarcinomaBoth UCC and high-grade RCC can present as centrally located renal neoplasmsInfiltrative high-grade RCCs, which may mimic UCC, include FH-deficient RCC, renal medullary carcinoma, RCC with sarcomatoid differentiation, collecting duct carcinoma, and RCC, unclassified typeRenal medullary carcinomas are rare, aggressive neoplasms characteristically occurring in young adults with hemoglobinopathiesBoth UCC and RCC may have extensive areas of sarcomatoid differentiation, and immunohistochemical stains may required to differentiate between the 2 entitiesCollecting duct carcinomas are increasingly rare with recognition of other high-grade RCCsMetastatic carcinomas may also rarely enter into the differential diagnosis of a high-grade, centrally located neoplasmA diagnosis of UCC will result in a nephroureterectomy ± bladder cuff, while RCC will result in a nephrectomyClear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma vs. Other Renal Neoplasms With Predominantly Clear CytoplasmClear cell RCC is most common, but other RCCs with predominantly clear cytoplasm, such as clear cell papillary RCC, or, less commonly, MCRNLMP, RCC with fibromyomatous stroma, and MiTF translocation-associated RCC, must also be consideredIn most cases, further classification is not required on frozen sectionRenal Neoplasms With Oncocytic CytoplasmClassically, the differential diagnosis has been between oncocytoma and chromophobe RCC, but there has been a recent expansion of renal neoplasms with oncocytic cytoplasmSDH-deficient RCC, eosinophilic solid and cystic RCC (ESC-RCC), and recently described eosinophilic vacuolated tumor (EVT) and low-grade oncocytic tumor (LOT) have broadened the differential diagnosisMany oncocytic neoplasms, including chromophobe RCC, may have areas with similar morphology to oncocytoma, so a diagnosis of oncocytoma on frozen section should be made with cautionA diagnosis of renal neoplasm with oncocytic features/cytoplasm is often sufficient on frozen sectionCystic LesionsCystic &/or necrotic RCC can be difficult to differentiate from hemorrhagic cysts on frozen sectionFrozen section diagnosis of \"cystic lesion\" with final deferment to permanent sections is appropriateCrush ArtifactCrushed benign renal tubules can be difficult to interpret in parenchymal margin sectionsFeatures supporting benign tubules are absence of

have broadened the differential diagnosisMany oncocytic neoplasms, including chromophobe RCC, may have areas with similar morphology to oncocytoma, so a diagnosis of oncocytoma on frozen section should be made with cautionA diagnosis of renal neoplasm with oncocytic features/cytoplasm is often sufficient on frozen sectionCystic LesionsCystic &/or necrotic RCC can be difficult to differentiate from hemorrhagic cysts on frozen sectionFrozen section diagnosis of \"cystic lesion\" with final deferment to permanent sections is appropriateCrush ArtifactCrushed benign renal tubules can be difficult to interpret in parenchymal margin sectionsFeatures supporting benign tubules are absence of nuclear atypia and the presence of glomeruli in adjacent tissueLesions With Foamy CytoplasmBenign lesions containing histiocytes with foamy or eosinophilic cytoplasm, such as malakoplakia or xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, may be difficult to distinguish from clear cell RCC on frozen sectionArchitectural pattern of small nests of cells with delicate fibrovascular septa favors clear cell RCCPapillary Adenoma at MarginGenerally, small lesions located away from main tumor"

removal by the surgeonChange in Patient ManagementIf malignancy is identified, the surgeon may elect to perform a lobectomy &/or sample lymph nodesMore limited surgery may be considered for adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA)However, a definitive diagnosis of AIS or MIA requires evaluation of the entire lesion on permanent sectionsA decision to alter the surgical approach requires clinical judgment based on a constellation of featuresIf a lesion cannot be identified in the specimen, the possibility that the lesion was not removed must be consideredClinical SettingAsymptomatic lung lesions may be detected when patients undergo lung cancer screeningThe United States Preventative Services Task Force has issued recommendations for screeningAnnual low-dose CT is recommended for individuals between the ages of 50-80 years with a 20 pack-year history of smoking exposure who currently smoke or have quit smoking within the last 15 yearsIncidental lung lesions may also be detected when patients undergo CT examination for other reasonsLung imaging by CT can detect small lesions (< 2 cm) and lesions of low density (ground-glass opacities)Lesions that require excision includeLesions increasing in sizeSolid or partially solid masses~ 75% are carcinoma and 25% are benign lesionsDiagnosis of small lesions and ground-glass opacities by needle biopsy can be difficultGround-glass opacity consists of an area of increased hazy density with preserved bronchial and vascular markingsMay be due to thickened alveolar septa or partial filling of air spaces with cells, fluid, or debrisAdequate sampling for definitive diagnosis is difficultSmall lesions can be difficult to target preciselyA wedge resection can be appropriate when the following criteria are consideredImaging shows a lesion of low risk for invasive carcinomaDiagnosis is expected to be AIS or MIA100% survival with excision onlyLymph nodes are not involvedThe surgeon must be aware that AIS and MIA can only be diagnosed after complete evaluation of the specimen on permanent sectionsPatient has limited lung capacity or other comorbidityContralateral lung surgery is plannedPatient preferenceSmall masses and ground-glass opacities may be difficult or impossible to identify in the lung during operationIn open resections, the surgeon may not be able to detect lesion by palpation with confidenceIn image-guided video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (iVATS), the lung is not accessible for palpationMultiple methods have been developed to assist in intraoperative identification of the lesionIntraoperative ultrasoundInjection of dye or fluorophorePlacement of hook wires, T bars, microcoils, or radioactive seedsThese methods can be used singly or in combinationA single marker can be used to localize a lesionAlternatively, 2 markers or a marker and dye can be used to mark the borders of a lesion or 2 separate lesionsThe surgeon performs the wedge resection to remove the area of the markersSPECIMEN EVALUATIONSpecimen RadiographA specimen radiograph may be performedCan document the presence of a radiopaque markerThe targeted lesion is unlikely to be seen due to the collapse of surrounding lung tissueGrossThe area indicated by the marker or dye is identified in the specimenThe intact specimen is gently palpated to attempt to identify the lesionIf the lesion is palpable, the location is noted with respect to the marker or dyePleura adjacent to the mass is inspected to determine if the lesion involves pleura or if pleura is freely mobile over the lesionIf a palpable mass is identified, the specimen is incised through the massThe entire mass is serially sectionedCarcinomas can be associated with fibrotic scarsThe presence of a firm mass adjacent to a scar is suggestive of carcinomaAll areas grossly suspicious for carcinoma should be evaluated by frozen sectionThe size of the mass and relationship to margin and pleura are notedRepresentative section(s) of mass and closest margin are taken for frozen sectionIf a palpable mass is not identified, the specimen is serially sectioned and each section carefully examined for visible lesions and gently palpatedThe lesion may be a subtle area of slightly increased firmness, paler in color than surrounding lung parenchymaFrozen SectionA representative section of the lesion is taken for frozen sectionIf carcinoma is identified, the closest margin should be examined by frozen section unless lobectomy is plannedThere are 2 methods to evaluate the marginThe standard method is to cut away the staple line and remove as little lung tissue with staples as possibleExposed lung parenchyma is inked to mark the parenchymal marginThe margin is taken as a perpendicular section, including inked tissue edge in area closest to lesionA 2nd method evaluates the tissue within and beyond the staple lineThis method can only be used with stapling devices that do not result in interlocked staplesThe exposed lung parenchyma at the edge of the staple line is inkedThe specimen is serially sectioned, and the margin closest to the lesion identifiedA section is taken perpendicular to the margin using scissors to cut through the staplesTissue is mounted with staples closest to the bladeAs the block is faced, the staples will become evident by grating against the cryostat blade and creating tears in tissueThe block and chuck are removed from the cryostatStaples are removed from tissue with forcepsThe embedding medium stabilizes the tissue and prevents it from being disruptedThe block and chuck are replaced in the cryostatSurface of tissue is covered with embedding medium to refreeze tissueThe blade is replaced or a different area is usedStaples may have caused nicks in bladeDeeper sections showing lesion and margin are takenThis method allows evaluation of the true tissue margin, which is beyond the staple lineMOST COMMON DIAGNOSESAdenocarcinoma In

Lobectomy or pneumonectomyParenchymal margin: Wedge resection and possibly lobectomyChest wall margin: Lung resection in continuity with adjacent ribs and chest wallPerformed in cases in which a carcinoma invades from lung into chest wallMany patients will have received preoperative therapy due to the extent of the tumorChange in Patient ManagementAdditional tissue may be resected to achieve a tumor-free marginResults may allow further intraoperative staging of patientResidual carcinoma at margins may be a poor prognostic factorPatients may receive additional therapyClinical SettingComplete resection with negative margins reduces local recurrence and may be curative in some patients with a malignant lung tumorResidual tumor at the bronchial margin may compromise the anastomosisSome patients may benefit from tumor debulking if complete resection of margins is not possibleSpread through air spaces (STAS) is a type of tumor invasion via detached clusters of cellsSTAS can be challenging to distinguish from artifacts and normal cells on frozen sectionThe sensitivity and specificity for this diagnosis is lower than that for other types of invasionConsensus on how to diagnose and report STAS on frozen section has not yet been achievedWhen STAS is at a parenchymal margin intraoperatively, some surgeons will perform a lobectomySPECIMEN EVALUATIONGrossBronchial marginIdentify the bronchus protruding from the specimenRecord the distance from the tumor to the marginCarcinomas > 3 cm away are rarely present at the bronchial marginAdenocarcinomas 2 cm from the margin grossly can be at the margin microscopicallySquamous cell carcinomas 1.5 cm from the margin grossly can be at the margin microscopicallyAn en face (shave) section of the entire (circumferential) bronchial ring is takenIf > 1 bronchus is present, sample all bronchiIf large, the bronchial ring may be bisected &/or > 1 frozen section block preparedAvoid including adjacent lung parenchyma and peribronchial lymph nodes in the sectionParenchymal marginLung specimens should be handled gently and sectioned with sharp blades to minimize artifactual displacement of tumor cellsSTAS can be mimicked by dispersal of tumor cells due to specimen handlingFor large resections &/or tumor not close to staple lineTrim away the staple line as close as possible to the staplesInk lung parenchyma revealed by the opening of the staple lineSerially section the specimen and determine closest approach of the carcinoma to the marginTumors > 1.5 cm away are very unlikely to have a positive marginA perpendicular section of the margin closest to the tumor is taken for frozen sectionFor small resections &/or tumor very close to staple lineSurgeons may try to minimize amount of tissue removed for patients with limited lung capacityUsing the method described above may result in a false-positive marginThe staple line includes 2-3 mm of lung tissue, and the true margin is at the far edgeRemoving staples often results in excessive tearing of tissue, which will then not be suitable for microscopic evaluation or contain artifactsIn selected cases, tissue within the staple line may be examined by frozen sectionThis method can only be used for systems that do not use interlocking staplesIf surgeons request this technique, they must use the correct type of staplesTissue is less likely to tear during removal of staples when it is frozen and stabilized in embedding mediumThe outer edge of the staple line is inkedThe lung tissue is serially sectioned up to the staple lineThe closest approach of the tumor to the staple line is identifiedThe staple line is cut with scissors in order to remove a block of tissue for freezingChest wall

evaluatedFrozen SectionBronchial marginEmbed the bronchial ring with the true margin face up such that the true margin is the 1st frozen sectionParenchymal marginIf the margin section does not include the staple line, the block of tissue is frozen with the inked margin at one edgeIf the margin section includes the staple line, the staples must be removed during the sectioning of the blockThe tissue is mounted on the chuck such that the blade passes 1st through the edge containing the staplesThe block is faced until the blade hits a staple or a staple can be seenThe noise made by the staple(s) grating against the blade identifies the locationAt this point, the staples will cause a tear in the sectionThe chuck is removed from the cryostat and forceps are used to gently pull the staples from the block by one end of the stapleThis must not be attempted within the cryostat as it is dangerous to work near the cryostat bladeThe frozen embedding medium stabilizes the tissue such that it is not damaged during staple removalThe surface of the block is covered with embedding medium and placed in the cryostat to refreeze the surfaceThe chuck is placed for cutting the tissue in the previous orientationA different area of the blade or a new cryostat blade is used as nicks may have been introduced by the staplesSections are then cut from blockThe tissue at the staple line appears pinched and compressedOval holes in the tissue identify the site of staplesTypically, 2-3 additional millimeters of tissue at the margin can be evaluatedChest wall marginA perpendicular section at the site closest to tumor is taken for frozen sectionCytologyTouch preps are usually not performed on lung marginsGeneral cytologic features of benign and malignant cells applyNot recommended for bronchial

diagnosis of malignancy is made, additional surgery may be performed to achieve tumor-free margins &/or for stagingSubtyping adenocarcinoma (e.g., acinar, papillary) is not necessary at the time of frozen sectionClinical SettingLung masses may be detected due to symptoms, by screening, or as incidental findingsSymptomatic: Usually larger in size (> 2 cm)Generally diagnosed prior to surgery through transbronchial or CT-guided biopsy and do not necessarily require confirmationScreen detected: Commonly small masses (< 2 cm) or ground-glass opacities (low density)Screening using low-dose CT has been recommended by United States Preventative Services Task Force for persons between ages 55-80 with a 30-year history of smoking who currently smoke or who have quit smoking within the last 15 yearsExcision is often necessary for diagnosis~ 70% primary lung malignancies, ~ 10% metastases, and ~ 20% nonmalignant lesionsMalignancies in this setting are more likely to be adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), or adenocarcinomas with lepidic patternAIS and MIA can only be diagnosed with certainty after complete evaluation of lesion on permanent sectionsIncidental: Lung masses may be detected on CT scans performed for other reasonsSPECIMEN EVALUATIONGrossMasses may be excised by wedge resection, lobectomy, or pneumonectomyThe pleural surface is carefully inspectedAdhesions: May be associated with inflammatory changes or invasion of tumor through pleuraPuckering: Usually due to retraction by carcinoma that has invaded into but not through pleuraPleural invasion is used for staging and is important prognostic factorLymphangitic spread: Extensive lymphovascular invasion is seen as white branching lymphatic channels on the pleural surfaceThe specimen is gently palpated to identify all masses and their relationship to any pleural changesThe pleura will not move freely over carcinomas that have invaded into pleuraThe specimen is completely serially sectioned to reveal any palpated mass and smaller &/or less firm massesAny areas of possible pleural involvement should be preserved for later evaluation by permanent sectionsThe size and location of all masses are recordedThe distance of lesions to parenchymal margins and bronchial margins is recordedFrozen SectionA representative section of the mass is frozenIf the lesion has a \"cheesy\" or necrotic surface, touch preps may be indicated in lieu of frozen sections to avoid potential contamination of the cryostat with infectious organisms (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis)If the mass is close to a surgical margin, the section is taken to demonstrate both the mass and marginCytologyTouch preps of the cut surface of a mass may be helpful if conservation of tumor tissue for permanent section is necessary or if infectious granulomatous disease is possibleIf lymphoma is suspected, fresh tissue is generally sent for additional ancillary testing (e.g., flow cytometry)If infection is suspected due to granulomas and necrosis, frozen sections should be avoided and tissue should be sent for cultureMOST COMMON DIAGNOSESAdenocarcinoma: Conventional/Nonlepidic PatternMost common diagnosisGenerally presents as a solid, discrete massMorphology (glandular vs. solid) depends heavily on the degree of differentiationDesmoplastic stroma or an extensive chronic inflammatory response is often seenMorphologic variants (e.g., papillary, mucinous, micropapillary, and solid with mucin production) are occasionally seenAdenocarcinoma: Lepidic PatternMay be seen on imaging as a ground-glass opacityGrossly forms an ill-defined, firmer area of lung parenchymaMultiple lesions may be presentLymphomas and focal pneumonia can have a similar gross appearanceThe histologic appearance resembles normal lung parenchyma with alveolar walls lined by atypical cellsAdenocarcinoma In Situ and Minimally Invasive AdenocarcinomaAIS and MIA are unlikely to form a mass by imaging and are more likely to present as ground-glass opacityExcellent prognosisMay be treated with limited (sublobar) excision and no sampling of lymph nodesA decision by the surgeon to perform more limited surgery should include consideration of imaging and patient featuresAIS and MIA can only be diagnosed with certainty after complete evaluation of the lesion on permanent sectionsIt is helpful for the pathologist to clearly indicate when AIS and MIA are excluded by frozen sectionClassification as AIS requiresSolitary lesion measuring < 3 cmPure lepidic growth patternNo invasionAbsence of tumor necrosis and invasion of vessels or pleuraAbsence of intraalveolar tumor spread within or beyond the tumor [spread through air spaces (STAS)]However, it is difficult to distinguish this finding from artifactual displacement of tumor cellsMIA is used for lesions that would otherwise qualify for AIS but have small (< 0.5 cm) areas of invasionIn the setting of multiple small invasive foci, the total percentages of invasive foci can be summed and multiplied by overall tumor diameterExample: 10% invasive component in 2-cm tumor = 2 x 0.1 = 0.2 cm estimated size of invasionSquamous Cell

completion axillary dissection may be performedIf no additional surgery is planned, there is no need for intraoperative evaluationIf lymphoma or infectious disease is detected, tissue is taken for ancillary studiesClinical SettingPatients with breast cancerLymph node evaluation is important for staging and prognosticationA negative SLN is highly predictive of a negative axillaClinical trials (e.g., ACOSOG Z0011) showed no significant survival benefit to completion axillary dissection in early-stage breast cancer patients with 1-2 positive SLNsAs a result, there has been a significant decline in frozen section evaluationIntraoperative SLN evaluation is still utilized in selected patients who would not fit Z0011 inclusion criteria, including those undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapyIn patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the detection of any disease in the SLN may lead to an axillary dissectionConservative management may be considered for low-volume disease (e.g., isolated tumor cells or micrometastasis)SLNs may be identified by injecting a blue dye, a radiolabeled solution (technetium-99), or bothPatients with axillary adenopathyAxillary lymph nodes may be enlarged due to reactive changes, infection, or malignancyAn excision of an axillary node may be performed for intraoperative diagnosisIn many cases, fine-needle aspiration or a core needle biopsy are used for this purposeSPECIMEN EVALUATIONGrossAll nodes are bluntly dissected from the specimen and carefully countedThe number of nodes present and the number with metastases are used to determine the need for additional surgeryIf each node is inked a different color, slices from multiple nodes can be frozen in the same blockThis allows the number of nodes with metastases to be determinedAll fat is trimmed away from the nodesIf a gradient of blue dye is present, the metastasis is most likely at the blue-stained poleEach node is thinly sliced at 2-mm intervalsIf the node is grossly suspicious for lymphoma or granulomatous/infectious disease, preservation of nonfrozen tissue for ancillary studies is helpfulFlow cytometry, frozen tissue (molecular studies), and hematopathology fixatives are used for suspected lymphomaCultures are used for granulomatous/infectious diseaseSLNs identified using technetium-99 do not expose pathology personnel to dangerous levels of radiationSpecial protective equipment or disposal of tissue are not necessaryHowever, if a new or nonstandard technique is utilized, levels of radiation and the resulting risk should be assessedHandling procedures should be approved by the institutional radiation safety officeFrozen SectionIf a grossly evident metastasis is present, only 1 representative section need be frozenScrape or touch preparations can also be used to document an obvious metastasisIf the procedure is an SLN biopsy, all slices of all grossly normal nodes are frozenAt least 1 H&E slide, including a complete cross section of all slices, should be evaluatedIf the purpose is to establish a diagnosis to explain adenopathy, only 1 representative section should be frozenCytologic preparations should be used, when feasible, to preserve tissue for possible ancillary studiesCytologyEach cut surface is scraped with a curved scalpel blade or glass slide and smeared on another slideEach node should be separately evaluatedUseful when either infection or lymphoma is suspectedTouch imprints, rather than scrape preparations, may be more helpful for lymphomaAlternative Method to Frozen Section1-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) is a currently available assay to detect epithelial cels in nodes based on amplification of cytokeratin 19 mRNA (Sysmex Corporation)Assay uses a homogenized tissue lysate of entire nodeThe equipment and reagents are expensive and are only available from one companyUsed as an alternative to frozen section in some countriesBoth OSNA and conventional frozen section detect macrometastases in the majority of cases (> 97%)OSNA detects more micrometastases, but the clinical usefulness of finding small breast cancer metastases is limitedOSNA can only detect

difficult to identifyIf Hodgkin lymphoma is strongly suspected and tissue is limited, tissue for flow cytometry, which will characterize the background inflammatory infiltrate, is of low priorityAcute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/LymphomaNeoplasm of precursor cells (lymphoblasts) that most commonly occurs in children but can be seen at any ageT-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL/LBL) is most common in adolescent male patients and often presents with large mediastinal mass; lymph nodes and extranodal sites may also be involvedB-cell ALL/LBL is most common in children < 6 years old and less frequently involves mediastinum; however, extramedullary involvement is common, particularly in CNS, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, testes, skin, soft tissue, and boneSpecific diagnosis is helpful during IOC, if possible, as mediastinal masses can show rapid growth, resulting in respiratory emergencyLymphoblasts in B-cell ALL/LBL and T-cell ALL/LBL are morphologically indistinguishableBlast morphology can vary from small cells with condensed chromatin, indistinct nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm to medium-sized cells with finely dispersed chromatin, variably prominent nucleoli, and moderate amounts of occasionally vacuolated cytoplasmNuclear contours may be round to irregular to convolutedCytologic preparations are often helpful in examining blast morphology, especially chromatin texture and presence of nucleoliTissue sections can provide helpful information in addition to cytologic appearance of cellsBlasts often show single-file infiltration of soft tissuesFrequent tingible body macrophages may give starry-sky appearanceMitotic figures are often numerousDepending on blast morphology, it may be difficult to distinguish ALL/LBL from mature or high-grade lymphomaClinical scenario and site of involvement are often helpful in suggesting ALL/LBL, and immunophenotyping may be necessary to confirm diagnosisAllocate tissue for flow cytometry and cytogenetic studiesIf tissue is limited, many cytogenetic lesions can be identified by FISH analysis on paraffin-embedded tissueMetastatic CancerPatients are usually older (> 60 years)Important to know any history of prior

especially for small lesionsA small number are associated with complications, such as pancreatitis, hemorrhage, and infectionEndoscopic biopsies may provide a diagnosis in some casesThus, it may not be possible to establish a diagnosis for some patients prior to surgeryClinical information can provide the most likely diagnosis prior to surgeryAge and sexThe majority (90%) of patients are > 45 years of ageAdenocarcinomas are most common from 60-80 years of age with a slight male predominanceNeuroendocrine tumors are equally common in men and women from 30-60 years of ageMucinous cystic neoplasms most commonly occur in women from 40-60 years of ageSolid pseudopapillary tumors most commonly occur in women from 20-40 years of ageImaging findingsHead of the pancreas: Bile duct obstruction and jaundice may lead to early detection of smaller tumorsTail of pancreas: Results in fewer symptoms and thus may present at a more advanced stageMucinous cystic neoplasms occur most commonly in tailA connection to the duct system is typical for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs)Complete pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) or distal pancreatectomy may be performed for potential cure or palliationBiopsies will be taken of lymph nodes, liver, or other possible sites of metastasesIf metastatic carcinoma is found, surgery for a cure is no longer possiblePatients with other types of metastatic pancreatic tumors may benefit from resectionSPECIMEN EVALUATIONGrossAll structures present are identified; not all will be present in all resectionsDistal stomach (not present in pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomies)Usually far from carcinoma and not evaluated by frozen sectionProximal duodenumDistal margin of duodenum is usually far from carcinoma and not evaluated by frozen sectionPancreas (head, tail, or complete pancreatectomy)SpleenInvolvement by carcinoma would be exceedingly unusual; not generally evaluated by frozen sectionGreat vessels: Superior mesenteric artery (SMA)Not resected; soft tissue around SMA may be sent to document cancerThe outer aspects of the specimen are examined to identify any areas of likely tumor involvementThe stomach is opened along the greater curvature and along the duodenal wall opposite the pancreatic headIf a partial pancreatectomy has been performed, the pancreatic parenchymal and pancreatic duct margins are identifiedEach margin is inked a specific designated color to distinguish it from other marginsEn face sections are taken for margin evaluationThe common bile duct margin is identified as it exits the pancreas and passes behind the proximal duodenumThe proximal common bile duct margin is inkedAn en face section is taken for margin evaluationThe uncinate process (posterior) margin is identifiedThis is a nonperitonealized portion of the pancreas lying directly on the superior mesenteric vessels for 3-4 cmThe surgeon must separate the pancreas from blood vessels and surrounding autonomic nerve plexusThis is an important margin and should be inked a specific color for evaluation on permanent sectionsThis margin is not typically evaluated by frozen section because it is fatty and 1 section is not likely to give an accurate evaluation of margin statusPartial pancreatectomy (head of pancreas)Probes are placed within the 2 major ductsThe probe in the common bile duct should exit through the ampulla of Vater in the duodenumThe probe in the main pancreatic duct is advanced as far as possibleThe duct may be obstructed by carcinoma prior to the ampulla of VaterThe pancreatic head is sectioned along the plane of both probesIf an area of duct obstruction is identified, this is the likely area of tumorCarcinomas are firm and white and efface the normal parenchymaIPMN is mucinous and papillary in appearance and fills the main duct and side branch ductsDistal pancreatectomyThe parenchymal margin is taken as an en face sectionThe pancreas is serially sectioned perpendicular to the long axisSize, color, borders, and relationship to margins of lesions are recordedSeparate en face parenchymal margin submitted by the surgeonIt is recommended that this margin be taken from the specimen by the pathologistIf submitted separately, the pathologist cannot evaluate the distance of a gross lesion involving the main duct from the marginFrozen SectionPancreatic parenchymal marginThe true margin is embedded face upThe 1st section is the true marginIf too large for a single frozen section, the tissue is divided into 2 frozen sectionsThe entire duct profile should be within 1 tissue blockBile duct marginThe true margin is embedded face upThe 1st section is the true marginUncinate marginNot usually examined by frozen

has been removedChange in Patient ManagementAfter removal of targeted parathyroid gland(s) or biopsy of a gland is confirmed, additional surgery is not necessaryIntraoperative differentiation of adenoma, multinodular disease, primary hyperplasia, from normal parathyroid glands may be used to guide surgeryIn rare cases, confirmation of a parathyroid carcinoma can guide completion of surgeryClinical SettingHyperparathyroidismThe morphologic correlates of the different types of hyperparathyroidism include parathyroid hyperplasia, parathyroid adenoma, and carcinomaThe precise diagnosis of parathyroid disorders depends on clinical features, laboratory results, genetic findings, and detailed morphologic assessmentPrimary hyperparathyroidismDefined as disease due to abnormal parathyroid gland functionPatients are usually diagnosed with hypercalcemia on serum tests and found to have elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH)Less commonly, patients present with symptoms of osteoporosis or renal calculi~ 80% have solitary adenoma~ 10% have 2 adenomas~ 10% have involvement of 3 or 4 glandsThis is considered primary hyperplasia and may be associated with lithium use, radiation exposure, or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromesSecondary hyperparathyroidismDefined as an increase in normal gland function in response to another disease stateParathyroid glands become enlarged and hyperfunctioning in response to low calcium levelsMost commonly due to renal failureCauses debilitating loss of calcium from bonesTertiary hyperparathyroidismAfter secondary hyperplasia, glands can start to function autonomouslySerum calcium becomes elevatedMEN syndromesHyperparathyroidism is almost always due to multiglandular/multinodular adenomasNot considered parathyroid hyperplasiaSurgery for thyroid resection or neck explorationParathyroid glands may be resected inadvertentlySurgical ApproachesPreoperative imagingParathyroid glands can be difficult for surgeon to identifyNormal glands are very smallNumber and location of glands can varyMost people have 4 parathyroid glands, 10% have ≥ 5, and 3% have < 415% are found in unusual locations: Mediastinum, within thyroid, thymus, and other sitesLymph nodes, thymic tissue, thyroid nodules, and other areas of nodular tissue may resemble glands grosslyThe number and location of abnormally enlarged glands can usually be identified by preoperative imagingUltrasound: Most commonAlso used to evaluate thyroid for abnormalities prior to surgerySestamibi scanTc-99m is taken up by hyperfunctioning glandsUseful to identify adenomas in unusual locationsLess useful to detect multiple hyperplastic glands4D CTMinimally invasive surgery may be used when the location of abnormal gland or glands is knownSurgery for adenoma with intraoperative PTH (IOPTH) assaySerum PTH is evaluated during surgeryPTH has a half-life of < 5 minutesDecreased PTH occurs within 10-15 minutes after removal of hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissueIf PTH decreases by > 50% after removal of an adenoma, further surgery is not necessaryFrozen section is not necessary for confirmation of parathyroid tissueIf PTH is not decreased, surgeon will search for 2nd adenomaIOPTH assays have largely replaced frozen section when availableIOPTH on a fine-needle biopsy of excised tissue can be used to document it is parathyroid tissueTissue aspirate is rinsed into 1 cc of normal salineSurgery for adenoma without IOPTH assaySurgeon visualizes all 4 parathyroid glandsAbnormally enlarged glands are

complete gland is frozenBiopsies are completely frozenCytologyMost helpful when used in combination with frozen sectionHighest sensitivity and specificity for correctly identifying parathyroid tissueAs single test, frozen section alone is superior to cytologic preparationsUseful to differentiate parathyroid cells from thyroid follicular cells or lymphocytesHowever, cytologic preparations tend to yield many bare nuclei and lack architectural features that are helpful in identifying parathyroid tissueSpecial StainsOil Red OParenchymal cells in normal glands contain large amounts of intracytoplasmic lipid dropletsIntracellular and extracellular parenchymal lipid content is decreased to absent in hyperfunctioning parathyroid cellsRim of normocellular parathyroid can be highlighted

if unexpected malignancy is identifiedOrgan transplant or organ harvesting for transplant may be canceledAdditional biopsies may be taken to identify the primary siteFor patients with known malignancy, surgery may also be alteredThe presence of metastatic disease may change the type of planned surgery (e.g., palliative instead of curative)For women with ovarian lesions, the peritoneum or omentum may be biopsied to determine if an invasive implant is presentIf found, the surgeon may choose to place a port for chemotherapyClinical SettingDuring abdominal surgery for benign or malignant conditions, the surgeon routinely explores the abdominal cavityIt is important to determine if any masses found are benign or malignant to guide subsequent surgerySPECIMEN EVALUATIONGrossMasses are generally completely removed as small excisional biopsiesIn a patient with an ovarian mass, omentum may be removed and sent for intraoperative consultation to assess for the presence and types of

number, color, and borders of lesions are recordedFrozen SectionSmall biopsies are completely frozenIn large samples, areas of fleshy tumor growth should be preferentially sampledAreas of extensive necrosis or mucin should be avoided as they are often nondiagnosticDiffusely infiltrative carcinomas in the omentum may be slightly paler and firmer than normal adipose tissueFrozen section evaluation of grossly normal tissue is of low yield and generally contraindicatedMOST COMMON DIAGNOSESMetastatic Carcinoma (Nonovarian)If the patient has a history of malignancy or current malignancy, it is important to be aware of the histologic type and whether or not the patient has been treatedTreated carcinomas can be difficult to detect due to sparse tumor cells, inflammation, and fibrosisTumors of the gastrointestinal tract often metastasize to the peritoneum and have a variety of histologic presentationsColon carcinoma is typically composed of glands with varying degrees of cystic dilationTall columnar tumor cells line the glandsExtensive central \"dirty\" necrosis is commonPancreatic carcinomas are often metastatic at time of surgeryThe neoplastic glands are generally smaller than those of colon carcinoma, lined by cuboidal cells, and lack \"dirty\" necrosisThe presence of mucinous glands, desmoplasia, and perineural invasion are often helpful features in identifying this tumorSurgery for curative intent is often aborted if metastatic disease is identifiedSignet-ring cell gastric carcinoma may metastasize widelySmall tumor cells with little cytoplasmic mucin may resemble histiocytes, lymphocytes, or reactive mesothelial cells and be difficult to identifyEnlarged cells with abundant mucin vacuoles that displace nuclei are easier to identifyLobular carcinoma of breast may have a similar appearance and can present as an occult primary siteThe signet-ring cells of lobular carcinoma tend to have a distinct central mucin droplet in a vacuoleThe signet-ring cells of gastric carcinoma tend to have multiple small cytoplasmic vacuolesThese carcinomas are typically not associated with desmoplastic responseInfiltrated adipose tissue may be slightly paler and firmer than normal tissuePseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a clinical syndrome caused by mucinous ascites and implants in the abdominal cavityPMP is most often secondary to a carcinoma of the appendix but can also be associated with colon, ovary, urachus, and pancreas primariesThe specimen is primarily composed of mucinOnly scant foci of mucinous epithelium may be present and may not be seen on frozen sectionNeuroendocrine tumors are typically composed of nests, cords, or trabeculae of tumor cells, which display vesicular (i.e., salt and pepper) chromatinCancers from nonabdominal sites also metastasize to abdomen but are less commonOvarian CarcinomaIn women with ovarian masses, serous tumors (borderline, low grade, and high grade) are most likely to be associated with metastasesHigh-grade carcinomas frequently display striking nuclear atypia, increased mitotic activity, and widespread disseminationLow-grade carcinomas often show destructive invasion of underlying structures but are cytologically bland compared to their high-grade counterpartsWomen with tumors of low malignant potential (borderline tumors) may have extraovarian implants at time of surgeryThe type of implant is an important prognostic factorNoninvasive implant (borderline tumor)Desmoplastic: Associated with marked stromal reactionForm smoothly contoured foci of glands surrounded by fibrous stromaPapillae and glandular structures often presentEpithelial: Not associated with marked stromal reactionCircumscribed clusters of glandsMay have branching papillae and detached cell clustersInvasive implant (low-grade serous carcinoma)Shows definite, irregular, destructive invasion with desmoplasia into normal underlying tissue structures\"Invasive implant\" is no longer accepted diagnostic terminologyIf invasion is present, then a diagnosis of low-grade serous carcinoma is appropriateIf an invasive implant is definitively identified on frozen section, the surgeon may opt to place a catheter for chemotherapy at the time of surgeryMesothelial LesionsMesothelial hyperplasiaReactive mesothelial hyperplasia is a relatively common findingAn inciting source of irritation, such as peritonitis or endometriosis, is often presentBy definition, invasion into underlying tissue is not presentNumerous patterns can be seenTufts, papillae, spindle cells, tubules, solid nests, and single cellsMesothelial cells generally show minimal nuclear atypia and have abundant cytoplasmMitoses are absent or rareNecrosis can be presentWell-differentiated papillary mesothelial tumorMay present as cystic or papillary massesMore common in womenGenerally detected as an incidental finding during surgeryUsually < 2 cm in size (although rare lesions are diffuse)Papillae have simple architectureSingle cell layerMonomorphic nuclei with minimal to no atypiaMitotic figures are rare or absentInvasion is not presentReactive and well-differentiated mesothelial lesions may be impossible to differentiate on frozen sectionThe surgeon should extensively sample the lesion for evaluation on permanent sectionsMalignant mesotheliomaMay present with myriad histologic patterns, including papillary, tubulopapillary, solid, sarcomatoid, and epithelioidTumors are often bulky and widespread and display invasion, necrosis, increased mitotic activity, and nuclear atypiaHowever, areas may be low grade in appearance and mimic a well-differentiated or reactive tumorThese tumors are typically readily evident to the surgeon as being malignantAdenomatoid TumorBenign proliferation of

              "URGICAL/CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS": "Goal of ConsultationTo identify a mass within the peritoneum as benign or malignantChange in Patient ManagementPlanned surgery may be altered if unexpected malignancy is identifiedOrgan transplant or organ harvesting for transplant may be canceledAdditional biopsies may be taken to identify the primary siteFor patients with known malignancy, surgery may also be alteredThe presence of metastatic disease may change the type of planned surgery (e.g., palliative instead of curative)For women with ovarian lesions, the peritoneum or omentum may be biopsied to determine if an invasive implant is presentIf found, the surgeon may choose to place a port for chemotherapyClinical SettingDuring abdominal surgery for benign or malignant conditions, the surgeon routinely explores the abdominal cavityIt is important to determine if any masses found are benign or malignant to guide subsequent surgery",
              "SPECIMEN EVALUATION": "GrossMasses are generally completely removed as small excisional biopsiesIn a patient with an ovarian mass, omentum may be removed and sent for intraoperative consultation to assess for the presence and types of implantsIn general, the specimen does not need to be inked, as primary isolated malignancies of the peritoneum are exceedingly rareThe tissue is serially sectioned and lesions identifiedThe size, number, color, and borders of lesions are recordedFrozen SectionSmall biopsies are completely frozenIn large samples, areas of fleshy tumor growth should be preferentially sampledAreas of extensive necrosis or mucin should be avoided as they are often nondiagnosticDiffusely infiltrative carcinomas in the omentum may be slightly paler and firmer than normal adipose tissueFrozen section evaluation of grossly normal tissue is of low yield and generally contraindicated",
              "MOST COMMON DIAGNOSES": "Metastatic Carcinoma (Nonovarian)If the patient has a history of malignancy or current malignancy, it is important to be aware of the histologic type and whether or not the patient has been treatedTreated carcinomas can be difficult to detect due to sparse tumor cells, inflammation, and fibrosisTumors of the gastrointestinal tract often metastasize to the peritoneum and have a variety of histologic presentationsColon carcinoma is typically composed of glands with varying degrees of cystic dilationTall columnar tumor cells line the glandsExtensive central \"dirty\" necrosis is commonPancreatic carcinomas are often metastatic at time of surgeryThe neoplastic glands are generally smaller than those of colon carcinoma, lined by cuboidal cells, and lack \"dirty\" necrosisThe presence of mucinous glands, desmoplasia, and perineural invasion are often helpful features in identifying this tumorSurgery for curative intent is often aborted if metastatic disease is identifiedSignet-ring cell gastric carcinoma may metastasize widelySmall tumor cells with little cytoplasmic mucin may resemble histiocytes, lymphocytes, or reactive mesothelial cells and be difficult to identifyEnlarged cells with abundant mucin vacuoles that displace nuclei are easier to identifyLobular carcinoma of breast may have a similar appearance and can present as an occult primary siteThe signet-ring cells of lobular carcinoma tend to have a distinct central mucin droplet in a vacuoleThe signet-ring cells of gastric carcinoma tend to have multiple small cytoplasmic vacuolesThese carcinomas are typically not associated with desmoplastic responseInfiltrated adipose tissue may be slightly paler and firmer than normal tissuePseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a clinical syndrome caused by mucinous ascites and implants in the abdominal cavityPMP is most often secondary to a carcinoma of the appendix but can also be associated with colon, ovary, urachus, and pancreas primariesThe specimen is primarily composed of mucinOnly scant foci of mucinous epithelium may be present and may not be seen on frozen sectionNeuroendocrine tumors are typically composed of nests, cords, or trabeculae of tumor cells, which display vesicular (i.e., salt and pepper) chromatinCancers from nonabdominal sites also metastasize to abdomen but are less commonOvarian CarcinomaIn women with ovarian masses, serous tumors (borderline, low grade, and high grade) are most likely to be associated with metastasesHigh-grade carcinomas frequently display striking nuclear atypia, increased mitotic activity, and widespread disseminationLow-grade carcinomas often show destructive invasion of underlying structures but are cytologically bland compared to their high-grade counterpartsWomen with tumors of low malignant potential (borderline tumors) may have extraovarian implants at time of surgeryThe type of implant is an important prognostic factorNoninvasive implant (borderline tumor)Desmoplastic: Associated with marked stromal reactionForm smoothly contoured foci of glands surrounded by fibrous stromaPapillae and glandular structures often presentEpithelial: Not associated with marked stromal reactionCircumscribed clusters of glandsMay have branching papillae and detached cell clustersInvasive implant (low-grade serous carcinoma)Shows definite, irregular, destructive invasion with desmoplasia into normal underlying tissue structures\"Invasive implant\" is no longer accepted diagnostic terminologyIf invasion is present, then a diagnosis of low-grade serous carcinoma is appropriateIf an invasive implant is definitively identified on frozen section, the surgeon may opt to place a catheter for chemotherapy at the time of surgeryMesothelial LesionsMesothelial hyperplasiaReactive mesothelial hyperplasia is a relatively common findingAn inciting source of irritation, such as peritonitis or endometriosis, is often presentBy definition, invasion into underlying tissue is not presentNumerous patterns can be seenTufts, papillae, spindle cells, tubules, solid nests, and single cellsMesothelial cells generally show minimal nuclear atypia

detected as an incidental finding during surgeryUsually < 2 cm in size (although rare lesions are diffuse)Papillae have simple architectureSingle cell layerMonomorphic nuclei with minimal to no atypiaMitotic figures are rare or absentInvasion is not presentReactive and well-differentiated mesothelial lesions may be impossible to differentiate on frozen sectionThe surgeon should extensively sample the lesion for evaluation on permanent sectionsMalignant mesotheliomaMay present with myriad histologic patterns, including papillary, tubulopapillary, solid, sarcomatoid, and epithelioidTumors are often bulky and widespread and display invasion, necrosis, increased mitotic activity, and nuclear atypiaHowever, areas may be low grade in appearance and mimic a well-differentiated or reactive tumorThese tumors are typically readily evident to the surgeon as being malignantAdenomatoid TumorBenign proliferation of mesothelial cellsCan occur in subserosa of uterus and in fallopian tube as

low-grade malignancies is not essential on frozen section as both will be treated with conservative excisionTo ensure margins are free of tumorChange in Patient ManagementIf high-grade malignancy present, the surgical procedure may be alteredIn parotid, a high-grade carcinoma is often treated with total parotidectomy, requiring facial nerve dissection with associated morbidityNeck lymph node dissection may be performedPatients typically receive adjuvant radiation therapy, possibly combined with chemotherapyPositive margins may prompt additional surgeryMany salivary tumors harbor characteristic genetic alterations: Triage of tissue for molecular testing may be helpful in selected casese.g., fresh tissue for karyotyping, in situ hybridization (ISH) on fixed tissueCharacteristic fusion genes are associated with pleomorphic adenoma, carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, secretory carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma, and clear cell carcinomaClinical SettingThe majority of tumors arise in the parotid gland, followed by the submandibular glandOnly ~ 20% of parotid tumors are malignant, compared to > 50% of tumors arising in minor salivary glandsSalivary gland tissue may not represent an intrinsic lesion, particularly in the parotid gland where peri- and intraparotid lymph nodes may be involved by metastatic disease or lymphomaFrozen section may be needed to resolve diagnostic uncertainty or unexpected findings following fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a salivary gland massDistinction of basaloid neoplasms, including basal cell adenoma, basal cell adenocarcinoma, and adenoid cystic carcinoma, may not be possible on FNACystic lesions may not yield diagnostic materialAtypia in pleomorphic adenoma raises concern about carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenomaHigh-grade malignancies (especially adenoid cystic carcinoma) may involve nerves with perineural spread well beyond the grossly evident tumorSPECIMEN EVALUATIONGrossGross features of the tumor are helpful for the differential diagnosisBenign tumors are typically circumscribedBenign and recurrent tumors may have multinodular growthHigh-grade carcinomas are often grossly infiltrativeIf the entire resection is sent for margin evaluation, precise orientation is essentialDirect consultation with the surgeon can be very helpful to identify the location of the closest marginsDifferential inking of the margins with multiple colors can be helpful to maintain orientationThe entire specimen is serially sectionedMargins may be sent as small biopsies from the edges of the surgical bed (\"defect sampling\") or may be taken from branches of the facial nerve to determine the extent of perineural involvementFrozen SectionSmall biopsies may be completely frozenPerpendicular sections of margins should be takenEn face margins are not capable of evaluating narrow (1-2 mm) but tumor-free marginsA negative but narrow distance to the margin may be clinically important and can only be assessed with a perpendicular sectionInfiltrative growth, perineural invasion, &/or lymphovascular invasion are indicative of malignancy, even in tumors lacking significant atypiaThe additional presence of pronounced cytologic atypia, necrosis, abundant mitotic activity, &/or atypical mitoses are associated with high-grade carcinomaCytologyTouch or scrape preps may be performed to evaluate tumorsCytology is not routinely used for margin evaluationMOST COMMON DIAGNOSESBenign Tumors and Low-Grade MalignanciesPleomorphic adenomaMost common benign tumorForms a mass with a well-circumscribed borderRecurrent pleomorphic adenoma can be present as multiple nodules within the surgical siteThis pattern should not be interpreted as invasionReadily diagnosed by FNA in most casesFrozen section analysis is limited to tumors with unusual or unexpected featuresCytologic atypia on FNA should prompt examination for malignant transformation and infiltrative growthNoninvasive or minimally invasive (up to 4-6 mm) carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma has a favorable clinical outcome compared to widely invasive tumorsSparse chondromyxoid matrix results in an appearance similar to basal cell adenoma or myoepitheliomaThe distinction is not critical among various possible benign tumor diagnoses on frozen sectionExtensive metaplastic changes make the distinction from other diagnoses challengingMay have squamous, mucinous, sebaceous, and oncocytic epithelial cells in addition to the usual ductal and myoepithelial componentsMay have myxoid, chondroid, adipocytic, and osseous mesenchymal elementsAdditional sampling of grossly distinct tumor areas may reveal more typical features of pleomorphic adenomaOncocytic and clear cell tumorsBoth oncocytic and clear cell features may be seen as nonspecific morphology in a variety of tumors (including mucoepidermoid carcinoma and acinic cell carcinoma)Prominent oncocytic features are

may be only technique that will yield individual cellsTechniqueScrape lesional cut surface 3-4x in same direction with clean, dry scalpel blade, accumulating semiliquid cell suspension on advancing edge of bladeGlass slide may be used instead of bladeScraping should be very gentle for soft cellular lesions to avoid overly thick smearsAdditional or more forceful scraping may be required for fibrous paucicellular tumorsCells can be directly smeared on 2nd slideAngled blade or slide with cell suspension is drawn directly across length of 2nd slide, depositing streak of suspended cellsAlternatively, cell suspension can be smeared between 2 slidesDrop of semiliquid cell suspension is placed at center of slide2nd slide is opposed to 1st, compressing cell suspension between 2 slidesThe 2 slides are separated in sliding motion, without added pressure, smearing suspension across both slidesRegardless of chosen technique, slides should be immediately immersed in fixative if H&E or Papanicolaou staining is plannedAdvantagesMore effective at producing cellular smears from some specimensMore easily samples entire surfaceImportant if cytology is being used to evaluate metastasis to lymph node or margin statusCaveatsAvoid excess scraping: Blade edge holds limited amount of suspensionAvoid excess manipulation: Smearing back and forth tends to damage cells (more cell damage is seen in \"2-slide\" method of smearing)Some areas of slide may be too thick for interpretationSquashMost appropriate lesionsGenerally only applicable for soft tissuePreferred technique of many neuropathologists, particularly for stereotactic biopsiesThere is often too little tissue for smear preparations and tissue may not be sufficiently cellular for touch imprintsTechniqueSmall (1 x 1 mm maximum) piece of abnormal tissue is separated from core or biopsy specimenLarger fragment may smear off end of slide and not be able to be examinedIf lesion is heterogeneous, multiple small fragments can be placed side-by-sideUsing forceps, gently place tissue near labeled end of slideDo not pinch or crush tissueIf there is significant liquid or blood, carefully dab corner of square of lens paper near tissue to absorb excessUsing another slide, firmly squash tissue and spread it along slide longitudinallyFor very soft tissues, only gentle pressure is necessaryToo much pressure will rupture cells with little cytoplasm (e.g., lymphomas or medulloblastomas)Separate 2 slides and immediately place in fixativeBoth slides are stained and coverslippedAdvantagesBest technique to demonstrate cells with long cytoplasmic processesShows 3D structure as well as single cell morphologyCaveatsMay help to perform squash over fixative jar to facilitate rapid fixationIf tissue is insufficiently soft, it may not be possible to use this techniqueSLIDE STAINING TECHNIQUESRapid-Fixed: H&E or Rapid PapanicolaouBoth techniques yield high quality nuclear detail and optimal cell preservationH&E preferred by most pathologists in intraoperative settingMore familiar to noncytopathologistsFacilitates correlation with tissue sections, especially concurrent frozen sectionsAir-Dried: Romanowsky (Diff-Quik/Wright-Giemsa)Good for preservation of cytoplasmic detail and extracellular matrix (e.g., chondroid, osteoid, or colloid)Accentuates differences among cell populations (e.g., metastases to lymph nodes, or biphasic tumors)Familiar to hematopathologists for lymphoid lesionsDIAGNOSTIC FEATURES OF COMMONLY ENCOUNTERED TUMORSAdenocarcinomaUsually high cellularityCombination of clustered and dispersed epithelioid cells with anisonucleosis, vesicular chromatin, and variably prominent nucleoli;

diagnosisOrientation should be maintained when importantSkin sections should be cut perpendicular to the epidermal surfaceColon sections should be perpendicular to the mucosal surfaceA tissue section should be ≤ 8 mm x ≤ 8 mm x 1-2 mm (thick) in size to freeze wellIf more tissue needs to be frozen, the section should be divided into multiple blocksIf moist, tissue should be gently blotted dryMinimizes freezing artifactHowever, do not use gauze or place tissue on gauze as this can introduce artifactual holes in tissueFreezing permanently changes tissueThe morphologic appearance of once frozen tissue is not the same as tissue that has never been frozenAs water freezes, ice crystals form in tissueLarger crystals form with time; tissue should be frozen as quickly as possible to minimize crystal sizeIce crystals disrupt cellular structures, and these changes are not completely reversed with thawingThe chromatin pattern of nuclei is often indistinctNuclei can appear hyperchromatic compared to tissue that has not been frozenAntigens can be altered by freezing, and this can change immunoreactivity patternsPreviously frozen tissue should be avoided for additional studiesIf used, results should be interpreted with cautionHistochemical stains can be altered on previously frozen tissueSmall primary tumors/lesions should never be completely frozen for these reasonsType of TissueAny tissue that can be cut with a scalpel can be cut by a microtome for frozen sectionBone and other heavily calcified lesions cannot be cutScrape preparations from bone may be used to evaluate marrow marginsHeavily calcified lesions are generally benign and need not be evaluated by frozen section intraoperativelye.g., an infarcted epiploic appendage often calcifiesAdipose tissue requires colder temperatures and is difficult to cutIf not important for diagnosis, fatty tissue should be dissected away from important areas of the specimene.g., lymph nodes should be dissected away from surrounding adipose tissueTissue fixed in formalin does not adhere well to slidesIf only immersed in formalin for a short time and of sufficient size, it may be possible to cut a central section that has not yet been exposed to formalinIf it is necessary to examine fixed tissue, special coated slides must be usedSlides must be handled very gently during staining to avoid tissue lossTissue with suspected or known infectious disease should not be frozen unless absolutely necessary for patient managementHigh-risk infectious diseases for pathology personnel are HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and tuberculosisCytologic preparations should be used when possibleIf a frozen section is prepared, the cryostat should be marked as contaminated and decontaminated after useTerminologyChuck: Metal platform used for holding embedding medium and tissue for sectioningBase: Embedding medium placed and frozen on chuck to cushion and protect tissueBlock: Tissue frozen on base and covered by additional embedding mediumPreparation of BlockThere are multiple methods of preparing a base of embedding medium according to the specific cryostat and equipment usedEmbedding medium is a liquid mixture that solidifies when frozen at appropriate temperature for cutting sectionsMay contain polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, resins, and other substancesA variety of commercial products are availableDensity is similar to tissue when frozenContainer must be kept capped when not in useAlcohol can evaporate and adversely alter the quality of the compoundIf the specimen is very small, a base can be precut and faced on the cryostat to minimize the amount of tissue lost to level blockTissue can be transferred to the frozen base by touching the base to the tissueOrientation can be important for margin sectionsPerpendicular margin sections should be placed such that the inked margin is clearly visible at 1 edgeOrientation of en face margins should be recordedSlides are labeled to indicate the 1st and subsequent deeper levelsIf the true margin is the superficial aspect of the tissue, the 1st frozen section slide is the true marginIf the true margin is embedded face down, the 1st frozen section is not the true marginIf positive, deeper levels can be obtained that are closer to the true marginMultiple fragments should be grouped closely but not overlappedTissue should not extend beyond the edge of the chuckThin sections can be rolled and embedded in cross sectionCyst wallSkin for evaluation of toxic epidermal necrolysis vs. staphylococcal scalded skin syndromeFreezing TissueEmbedding medium is applied to completely cover the tissue sitting on the baseShould not extend beyond chuckIf medium extends to back or stem of chuck, it must be removed or it will interfere in attaching the chuck to the cryostatEmbedding medium can be kept cool in refrigerator to speed freezing processShould form a rim around tissue to aid in holding tissue and tethering the section to chuck when cuttingThe block is placed in the cryostat to freezeSome cryostats have rapid freezing cyclesAlternative methods use a bath of isopentaneDifferent types of tissues cut optimally at different temperaturesMajority of tissue: -10 °C to -20 °CVery soft tissue (brain, spleen, adrenal gland, lymph node): -7 °C to -10 °CAdipose tissue: -20 °C to -40 °CMethods to Accelerate FreezingHeat extractorThis is a metal block that may be attached to a handle and is kept cold in cryostatAfter the embedding medium is slightly cooled (and appears opaque), the extractor can be placed on top of the blockIt should not be used immediately as it will compress and distort tissue that is still softThe use of the heat extractor creates a flat surfaceIf the extractor sticks to the block, the stem of the chuck can be gently knocked against the freezing plateIf the block detaches from the chuck, it can be reattached to a new chuck with embedding mediumA small amount of oil on an extractor can prevent stickingCooling plateSome cryostats have a quick freeze option that cools the plateAfter embedding medium is opaque, the block is placed face down on the plateRapid freezing aerosol spraySprays are available to cool the face of the block quicklyThere are multiple formulationsMany use carbon dioxide and propellantNot recommended due to increased risk of inhalation of infectious disease organisms or toxic fumesExposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis is reported after use of this type of spray on infected tissueIf used, spray should be within cryostat with lid closed as much as possible to contain sprayCryostat should be free of shavings that will contribute to contaminationFace masks should be wornSectioning on CryostatThe chuck is positioned in the microtome such that the blade 1st cuts the most solid area of tissueSolid areas of tissue should be positioned closest to the bladeAdipose tissue should not be 1st portion of tissue cutEpidermal or mucosal surfaces should be perpendicular to the bladeThe most important part of the tissue should not be the 1st area cutThe leading edge of the section is the area of tissue most likely to show artifacts of compression or foldingThe blade must be sharp and without nicks in order to create complete thin sectionsDull or nicked blades result in sections with chatter artifact &/or holesThe block is trimmed or faced until a complete section is obtainedBases can be prefaced prior to adding a specimen to minimize tissue loss when facing blockRough cut sections can be removed from the blade with a large brush or swabDiscarded sections should be brushed away in the same direction as the blade cutsThe blade can be nicked or dulled if brushedDiscarded sections should never be removed by hand due to the risk of severe laceration from the bladeSome cryostats use an antiroll plate to hold the cut tissue section flat against plateThe tissue section is left slightly attached to the block to prevent curlingAs an alternative to an antiroll plate, a brush can be usedThe tissue section is guided onto the plate with a brush at the leading edge of the tissue sectionThe section is left slightly attached to the block to prevent curlingBrushes are kept cold within cryostatA glass slide is gently applied to the surface of the tissue sectionSlides should be labeled with the case number and a designation for frozen sectionThe label must be able to withstand solutions used for stainingFrozen tissue rapidly melts onto a slide at room temperatureFixationAs soon as slides are prepared, they must be immediately placed in methanolA methanol container with a slide holder should be within easy reach of the cryostatAny delay results in significant air-drying artifact, which impedes interpretationDisposition of Frozen TissueThe remaining tissue should be fixed in formalin and submitted for permanent sectionIf multiple chucks are present in the cryostat, each one can be identified by labeling the surface with a felt tip markerThe frozen tissue block can be immersed in formalin to cause slight melting and removed with a hand or rulerFrozen tissue should not be removed using a bladeThe chuck is small and the tissue block is hard; the force required to sever the block can result in loss of control of the blade and injury to the nondominant handSmall frozen section remnants are wrapped in lens paper before being placed in a labeled cassetteExcess embedding medium should be trimmed awayThe comparison of the frozen section to the permanent section is an important quality assurance parameterIf there is a difference in interpretation, the surgeon must be notified and the reason for the discrepancy explained in the pathology reportIf frozen tissue is required for ancillary studies, and additional tissue is not available for freezing, the frozen section remnant can be retained for this purposeLevelsIf very little tissue is present, the initial levels should be shallow to ensure some tissue is captured before all tissue is sectionedSequential levels can be taken for staining rather than going deep into sectionIf a large section is present, or if multiple fragments are present, the frozen section should be a representative cross section of all tissueAfter cutting and fixing, all tissue in the block should be represented on the slideIf not, deeper levels should be takenImportant diagnostic information can be lost if some tissue is not presentDeep levels can be helpful when examining margins to look for small areas of tumor near the marginRequires cutting deep into section and discarding some of the intervening tissueDeep levels should not be used for small biopsies of diagnostic tissue if the tissue is limitedAt least 2 levels should be obtained for each frozen sectionEvaluation of Lung Parenchymal Resection Margin With StaplesClinical settingPreservation of lung parenchyma may be important for patients with compromised lung function or if multiple lesions are presentThe true margin is the tissue within staple line~ 2-3 mm of lung parenchyma is within staple lineStaples cannot be removed from the fresh specimen as this results in tearing of tissue precluding optimal evaluationFor some patients, evaluation of the true margin is of value in order to document a cancer-free margin and to avoid unnecessary removal of additional tissueSurgical techniqueThis method can only be used for staples that do not interlockMethodThe outer edge of the staple line is inkedThe lung specimen is sectioned perpendicular to the staple line to determine the location of the tumor and the distance from the staple lineThe section of tissue with the closest approach of tumor to staple line is identifiedThe portion of the section containing staples is cut with scissorsThe block on the chuck is positioned in the cryostat such that the blade passes 1st through the edge of the tissue containing staplesThe block is faced until the blade hits a staple or a staple can be seenThe blade hitting a staple makes a grating soundStaples cause tears in sectionThe chuck is removed from the cryostatForceps are used to pull the staple (or staples; generally no more than 1-2) from the blockBecause the tissue is frozen in place, minimal tearing occurs when staples are removedRemoving staples should not be attempted in the cryostatProximity to the blade could result in serious lacerationAfter staples are removed, the surface of the block is covered again with embedding medium and refrozen in the cryostatThe chuck is positioned in the cryostat in the same orientationA new cryostat blade (or new area of the same blade) should be used as there may be nicks caused by the staplesSections are cut from the blockThe tissue where the staples were located will look pinched on the slidesOval holes in the tissue identify the site of where the staples were removedThe true margin is the tissue at the inked edge beyond the holesTROUBLESHOOTINGSection Shows Shatter (or Chatter) ArtifactThe appearance is similar to a Venetian blindDue to breaks in tissue parallel to bladeBlock too coldThe block can be slightly warmed with a thumb or palmThe section must be cut immediately because the block will rapidly coolMost superficial section may be too warmA few sections may need to be discarded to get to a level with optimum temperature for sectioningCare must be taken to prevent injury to the handMove block as far from blade as possibleLock handwheel to prevent block from movingCryostat blade dull, nicked, or missingReplace with new bladeMake sure blade has been installedTissue too hardFragments of bone or other calcified tissue may be too hard to sectionTissue that cannot be cut easily with a scalpel should not be selected for frozen sectionIf possible, soft tissue should be separated away from hard tissueSection is not cut in continuous motionThe handwheel should be turned with a smooth motionHesitation or stopping before completing a section can result in tearsSections Crumple Into Mass on BladeBlock too warmLeave block in cryostat longerAfter initial sections, center of block may not be sufficiently coldUse heat extractor or other mechanism to cool block rapidlyBlade is at wrong angleAngle should be adjusted to 30°Edge of section may not be transferring well to plateUse brush to catch leading edge of section and guide onto plateIf there is excessive embedding medium, cut down to V shape around tissueTip of V is easier to catch with a brushIf using a plate to hold sections, check adjustmentFrozen Block Falls Off ChuckBlock may be knocked off chuck by bladeChuck may be loose, blade may be at wrong angle, or section width may be too thickBlock may stick to heat extractor and detach from chuckA drop of oil on the surface of the heat extractor will keep it from sticking to the blockThe block can be reattached to new chuck using embedding medium; allow to cool before cuttingBlade Does Not Cut BlockBase is softAllow more time for freezingA previously prepared base is usedBases that go through freeze and thaw cycles overnight will be soft and crumblyThe blade may push embedding medium down rather than cutting through itAll bases should be newly prepared same dayVery Small SpecimensIt can be challenging to capture enough of a small specimen for diagnosisTouch preparations may be adequate for some small specimensThe base can be prefaced in the cryostat to avoid loss of any tissue when facing tissue for frozen sectionsTissue can be dipped in eosin to aid in identifying it when covered with embedding mediumEosin does not interfere with normal stainingTissue can be placed in a drop of embedding medium placed on top of a cooled chuck (\"wet embedding\")The heat extractor is held gently on top of the embedding medium in order to not crush tissue before it is adequately frozenHelps prevent ice crystal artifactAdipose TissueFatty tissue is very difficult to cut wellIf fatty tissue is not important for the diagnosis, as much as possible should be trimmed awayLymph nodes are more easily examined when there is minimal fat attachedThe block may cut better when colder than normal for frozen sections (< -20 °C down to -50 °C)If other methods do not work, thicker sections can be cutThick and Thin SectionsChuck or blade are looseThe stem of the chuck must be firmly attached to the cryostatThe blade must be firmly attachedAir-Drying ArtifactAfter staining, cells look splayed out with smudgy chromatin and indistinct cell bordersA jar of fixative must be kept very close to the cryostatSlides must be fixed immediately after sectioningIce Crystal ArtifactTissue is riddled with holes or looks compressed due to formation of large ice crystalsTissue is

            "raw_text": "INTRODUCTIONImportance of Gross ExaminationGood gross evaluation often provides more information and can be more accurate than microscopic evaluation for intraoperative consultation (IOC)Large specimensCritical for optimal evaluationThe tissue most likely to yield the most important findings for intraoperative management must be identifiedIn some cases, gross examination is adequate for IOCMargins for colon carcinomas in absence of prior treatmentMargins for sarcomas in absence of prior treatmentCircumscribed thyroid nodules: Microscopic evaluation for focal capsular or vascular invasion is best performed on permanent sectionsMargins for bone tumors in the absence of prior treatment: Can be more accurate than frozen sectionsSmall specimensOften entirely frozenGross examination primarily for documentation of sizeGross examination should also distinguish tissue from a blood clot or other materialObjectives of Gross ExaminationDocument specimens receivedNumber of specimensIdentification of each specimenDetermine important gross pathologic featuresAppearance of tumorsGross appearance is often highly correlated with histologic typeNumber of tumorsDistance of multiple tumors from each otherTumor sizeOften best determined when tissue is freshLocation of tumorsWithin the specimen or with respect to other structuresGross distance from oriented margins prior to contraction (colon and skin)Select best areas for frozen section evaluationMargins should be serially sectioned to identify the closest approach to marginCystic ovarian tumors should be examined to identify the most likely areas of invasive carcinomaUteri examined to identify the deepest area of invasionThe best section for tumor identification is usually the interface with normal tissueCentral necrotic &/or fibrotic areas should be avoidedSelect best tissue for special studiesCentral areas of tumors are often fibrotic or necroticThe most viable areas of the tumor is typically at the interface with normal tissueAdjacent normal tissue should not be included for most assaysDOCUMENTATIONSmall SpecimensGross description includesSize of specimensNumber of fragmentsColor of tissueRed friable fragments may be fibrin and blood and not tissueConsistency (e.g., hard, firm, rubbery, soft)Recognizable features (e.g., polyp, squamous mucosa, epithelium)Large SpecimensGross description includesType of organs/tissue presentSize of each componentLocation of any lesions (tumors, ulcers)Distance of lesions from marginsORIENTATION OF MARGINSImportanceCorrect orientation is necessary to determine the distance of malignancies from marginsClose or positive margins may be an indication for additional removal of tissue in designated areasSurgeon should indicate if margin evaluation is needed for intraoperative managementPathologist should always verify orientation provided by surgeonAny questions about orientation should be addressed prior to further specimen processingTechniquesSuturesSurgeons may place multiple sutures to indicate specific marginsSeveral methods are used to indicate margins identified by suturesDifferent materials of different colorsDifferent lengths (e.g., short = superior margin; long = lateral margin; often used for breast specimens)Tied suture vs. blanket stitchDifferent numbers of surgical clips or commercial markers attached to suturesSutures of different colors should be documented before inkingLight-colored sutures may be difficult to distinguish after being inkedDiagramA good method to indicate orientation for complex specimensSeparate specimensEach margin may be sent as separate excisionINKING MARGINSMethodsIn general, ink should be applied to specimens prior to sectioningSpecimen surface should be dry and clean (i.e., without gross blood)Gauze pads or cotton swabs are used to apply inkInk should not be introduced into crevices or other areas of a specimen that are not true marginsFor large complex specimens, it may be preferable to ink selective areasInking entire specimen may make later orientation and identification of structures difficultArtifactual smearing of ink onto nonmargins can occurOften possible to identify most important margins to examine by frozen section with consultation with surgeonOnly those margins need be inked for IOCOrientation of uninked specimen will be easier to determine by prosectorIt is helpful for institutions to develop routine policies for correlation of colors with specific marginsIdeally, the same color should always be used for the same marginPROCESSING THE SPECIMENImagingInformation from preoperative imaging is often helpful to guide gross examinationSize, location, and number of lesions is usually known preoperativelyIf a specimen (e.g., breast biopsy) undergoes imaging after excision, the specimen radiograph should be available to the pathologistThe radiograph is helpful to identify lesion type (mass, calcifications, clip, radioactive seed), location, and radiologic distance to marginsMethodsStandard methods for processing specimens should be usedSurgeon should provide information about structures present and mark any that are not grossly evidentAll external anatomic structures must be identified prior to inking the specimenInk can make it more difficult to identify structures and marking devices (i.e., clips or sutures)Minimal examination (e.g., not completely sectioning specimen) may lead to suboptimal evaluationAdditional lesions smaller than the primary lesion may be missedClosest approach of malignancy to margin may not be identifiedSpecimens must be examined on a clean surface away from other specimensContamination from other specimens can create diagnostic errorsScalpels, other blades, forceps, and probes must be new or meticulously cleaned if previously usedGloves and other protective clothing must be cleanLarge, potentially cystic masses must be opened with careA deceptively firm to hard mass can actually be a cystic tumor with fluid under pressureA puncture can result in forceful expulsion of cyst contents with contamination of environment and prosectorPossible cysts should be opened carefully, preferably near a sink or with abundant pads capable of absorbing any contentsA small nick should be made on the surface away from prosectorSpecimens can change shape and size after excisionColonColon segments can contract 40% within 10-20 minutesDistances of rectal carcinomas to the distal margin should be measured as soon as possibleThis distance may be used to determine the need for radiation therapySkeletal muscleSkeletal muscle in resections can contract when cut with a blade (e.g., resections for sarcomas of thigh)This phenomenon can be quite alarming when 1st encounteredSkinContraction occurs within 5 minutes of excisionBreastExcisions flatten spontaneously or due to compression during specimen radiographySectioningSharp blades must be usedDull blades are difficult to use and may result in injury to prosectorTissue may be crushed rather than cutDifficult to obtain sections of optimal thinness for frozen section and fixationParallel sections preferable to multiple cuts in different planesPreserves ability to orient specimenEnsures the entire specimen is examinedHowever, perpendicular sections in different planes may be necessary to evaluate multiple margins of some specimensA single large cut to bisect a large, complex specimen may be adequate in order to identify tissue for ancillary testingThe best area of tumor for studies can be identified (central or periphery)If multiple areas of different gross appearances are present, it may be helpful to take paired samples for histology and ancillary testingThe specimen orientation is maintained for further dissection and photographyHollow organs should be opened such that a tumor is not transected, when possibleInformation from imaging or endoscopy may be helpful to identify the tumor locationThe outer surface can be palpated to identify the location of a massA finger can be introduced (e.g., into a colon segment) to identify the massOpening all hollow organs is often helpful to orient the specimen and to identify structuresIMPORTANT GROSS FEATURESSize of TumorsSize should be carefully determined and recorded in fresh, unfixed tissueThe final size should be correlated with microscopic appearance on permanent sectionsImportant for staging of some tumorsMay diminish slightly after fixationMay be difficult to determine after sectioningMay be difficult to determine if tissue is taken for special studiesSize prior to removing tissue must be documentedDistance of Malignancies From MarginsOften used to determine adequacy of surgical resectionAdequate margin varies for different types of tumors, sites, and clinical settingse.g., the distance of rectal carcinomas from the distal margin may be used to determine the need for radiation therapyThe gross distance from the margins should always be correlated with microscopic appearanceA margin grossly far from a tumor should not be interpreted as positive on microscopic examination unless a clear reason for discrepancy is identifiedTumor has a diffusely infiltrative pattern not appreciated grosslyTumor is present in tissue plane not seen grossly (e.g., esophageal adenocarcinoma present in muscularis propria at margin beneath grossly negative squamous mucosa)2nd smaller focus of tumor present at marginOther possibilities should be considered before interpreting such a margin as positiveInk leakage into specimen fissures or artifactually introduced onto nonmargin surfacesTumor present in lymphatics that would not be an indication for additional surgery (e.g., at bronchial margin)Nonmalignant cells that could be misinterpreted as malignancy (e.g., atypical ductal hyperplasia in breast excision)Multiple TumorsMultiple tumor masses may be present due to numerous reasonsArea of carcinoma in situ giving rise to multiple invasive cancersIntralymphatic tumor giving rise to multiple metastatic sitesFragmentation of a single tumor due to transection during surgeryMultiple biologically separate tumorsMore common in patients with germline mutations (e.g., breast cancer) or environmental exposures (e.g., skin carcinoma in sun-damaged skin)Multiple tumors are important to recognize when taking tissue for ancillary studies and for margin evaluationILLUSTRATIONPhotographyA photograph of the intact specimen is useful for later documentationCan be helpful to identify location of sections for

important featuresLocation and relationship of structures and lesions presentLocation and colors of inksSites where tissue has been sampledTISSUE ALLOCATIONDocumentationDistribution of all tissue from surgical specimen should be documentedSize and types of tissue sent to other laboratories should be recordedLaboratory, investigator, or other identifying information should be includedIn rare cases, tissue may need to be retrieved if inappropriate tissue is allocated or there is an unexpected diagnosis on permanent sectionsTissue saved by means other than standard formalin fixation is documentedFormalin FixationIn general, at least some tissue should be fixed in a standard manner in formalinThe majority of studies of immunohistochemical markers have been performed on formalin-fixed tissueFormalin penetrates slowly, and complete fixation may require many hoursSpecimens should be serially sectioned to ensure all areas are adequately exposed to fixativeIf a specimen is large and complete fixation may be delayed, thin slices of tumor should be fixed quickly in a separate formalin containerIt may be helpful to include normal tissue as a control for immunohistochemical studiese.g., normal breast tissue can be combined with breast carcinoma as control for hormone receptorsIdeally, fixation occurs within 1-2 hours after blood supply is terminatedBiomolecules degrade at different ratesPhosphoproteins and mRNA can degrade within minutesOther types of proteins and DNA may degrade after hoursThe time when a specimen is placed into fixative should be documented when feasibleOther FixativesTissue may be saved in other types of fixatives when appropriateHistologic features of lymphomas often best preserved in special fixativesElectron MicroscopyTissue must be minced into small fragments (~ 1 mm x 1 mm x 1 mm) for rapid fixationSpecial fixation is necessary to preserve ultrastructural detailFlow CytometryTissue must be unfixedTissue should be kept moist in saline or in culture mediumCytogeneticsTissue must be unfixed and viableTissue can be placed in sterile tissue culture medium for transfer to laboratoryFrozen TissueCan be used for mRNA and DNA studiesMany studies can also use formalin-fixed tissueIf diagnostic tissue is limited, tissue used for frozen section diagnosis can be kept frozenResearchTissue can only be released for research if not required for care of patientOnly the pathologist can make this determinationIndividuals requesting tissue must have approval from institutional human studies committeeINFECTION PRECAUTIONSGross Findings Suggestive of InfectionIf a specimen has findings suspicious for infection on gross examination, special handling should be consideredNecrosis without discrete tumor massLung consolidationCytologic preparations should be used when possibleMinimizes risk of infection by tissue injury from bladesAvoids aerosolization during frozen section preparationMinimizes contamination of equipmentTissue From Patients With Known or Suspected Infectious DiseaseThe surgeon should always provide information about patients with possible infectionsTissue from patients with diseases that can be transferred percutaneously or by inhalation must be handled with cautionHepatitis B and hepatitis CHIVTuberculosisThe diagnosis should be deferred to permanent sections on fixed tissue when possibleCytologic preparations should be used when possibleUnfixed slides should not be submitted to other laboratories for examinationTissue from patients known or suspected to have prion disease (e.g., Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) should not be examined by IOCSymptoms include rapidly progressive dementiaTissue must undergo prolonged fixation in special fixatives to inactivate prionsRisk to personnel too high and potential benefit to patient with rapidly fatal disease too small to warrant examination",

            "raw_text": "IntroductionClinical SettingThe intraoperative detection of a lymph node metastases can be important for the management of patients with cancerComplete axillary dissection may be performed for some patients Positive palpable nodes3 or more positive nodesPositive nodes after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT)There is no need for intraoperative consultation unless lymph node status will alter the surgical planResection for a possible cure may not be attempted for sites such as the pancreas or lungRemoval of additional nodes after a positive node is identified may not be required for staging and often increases morbidityReverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect mRNA transcripts specific to epithelial cells has been proposed as an alternative to frozen section (FS) for the diagnosis of metastasesThe majority of investigations have studied breast cancer, but lung, colorectal, gastric, gynecologic, prostate, and head and neck cancers have also been studiedReverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain ReactionMethodProbes for mRNA transcripts are used to amplify corresponding sequences from mRNA prepared from lymph nodesThe transcripts are chosen to represent genes transcribed in the majority of epithelial cells but not in hematopoietic cellsMultiple methods have been investigated but only 1 is currently commercially availableOne-Step Nucleic Acid AmplificationMarketed by Sysmex Corporation in Hyogo, Japan (LYNOAMP)Uses 6 primers to amplify mRNA for CK19Adopted in ~ 290 hospitals worldwide, including > 10% of hospitals in the United KingdomNot used widely in the United StatesA lysate is made from a lymph node and analyzed by a proprietary deviceAn RT loop-mediated isothermic amplification is used to detect the targeted sequenceThe number of mRNA copes per μl is determined and used to classify the type of metastasisThe lower level of detection is set to attempt to not detect isolated tumor cellsComparison of Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction and Frozen SectionTypes of Diseases DetectedFS detects all types of disease processes in lymph nodesIn addition to carcinoma, FS detects melanoma, lymphoma, infections, and other lesionsRT-PCR only detects mRNA transcripts from epithelial cellsClassification of MetastasesTraditionally, lymph node metastases have been classified as macrometastases, micrometastases, and isolated tumor cells based on sizeRT-PCR uses the number of mRNA transcripts to approximate the size of the metastasisThe number of mRNA transcripts is only loosely related to the amount of protein present and may not always accurately reflect the amount of tumor presentMisclassification in comparison to size by histology is likely for some casesWhether or not the size of a metastasis as determined by FS or the number of mRNA transcripts is preferable for clinical use has not yet been determined for all tumors and applicationsExtent of Metastatic Disease DetectedBoth RT-PCR and FS are very effective at detecting macrometastases (> 97% sensitivity)RT-PCR detects ~ 2-4x as many micrometastases compared to FSWith conventional lymph node evaluation, ~ 20-25% of all metastases are micrometastasesWith RT-PCR, the number of micrometastases can be similar or greater to the number of macrometastasesThe clinical utility of finding small metastases may vary with the tumor type and clinical settinge.g., small metastases have little prognostic importance for breast cancers in the absence of NATThe prognostic significance of very small metastases after NAT needs to be determinedMore patients will be classified as having positive lymph nodes with RT-PCRRT-PCR can quantify metastases that are present as multiple foci within a single node or involving multiple nodesThe total tumor load (the number of mRNA transcripts added across multiple nodes) can be determinedThis is being investigated as a predictor of nonsentinel node metastasisFalse-Negative and False-Positive ResultsThe RT-PCR false-positive rate is reported to be ~ 2.5% if tissue allocation is excludedPossible causes are leaky transcription from nonepithelial cells, contamination of the specimen, or benign epithelial inclusionsThe reasons are difficult to study because the entire node is utilized for the assayFS results in only very rare false-positive results (< 1%)The RT-PCR false-negative rate is reported to be ~ 8% if tissue allocation is excludedPossible causes are cancers that do not express the evaluated keratin, necrotic carcinomas, or carcinomas with cautery artifactFS results in only very false-negative results for macrometastases (< 3%)However, metastases < 0.2 cm in size may or may not be detected as not all tissue is evaluatedTissue Allocation for Lymph Node EvaluationIn validation studies, nodes were evaluated by both H&E and one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA)Alternate slices were allocated to OSNA and histopathologyDiscordant results due to tissue allocation are inevitableSuboptimal results can result for both techniquesFalse-negative results occur due to the metastasis not being in the tissue allocatedThe mRNA transcript number may be reduced if the entire node is not evaluated, potentially resulting in incorrect classificationA positive result by OSNA and a negative result by H&E [i.e., AJCC pN0 (mol+)] leaves patients not knowing whether or not metastatic disease is presentMolecular result may be false-positive resultMolecular method may detect minimal tumor involvement not detected by histopathologyMolecular method may detect a macrometastasis that was missed by histopathology due to tissue allocationTherefore, appropriate node classification could be N0, N0 (i+), N1mi, or N1Thus, for clinical use, it is preferable to evaluate a lymph node by either FS or OSNA but to not use both for the same lymph node",

level to guide intraoperative managementFS for the identification of adenomas is now rarely performedCurrently, there are numerous alternative approaches to intraoperative diagnosis that are replacing, or may replace, FS in the near futureSome of these methods require the involvement of pathologists, and others replace pathology interpretation with optical or chemical/molecular analyses that are directly available to the surgeonMany of these methods are being combined with artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) to assist in the interpretation of the dataAI/ML programs could potentially provide diagnostic information to the surgeon without the need for pathologic consultationIt is important for pathologists to be aware of techniques that may become part of their diagnostic armamentarium, as well as techniques that will not be used by pathologists but will need to be validated against the current standard of careEX VIVO MICROSCOPY: FRESH TISSUEOverviewMultiple methods are under development to obtain high-resolution microscopic images directly from fresh tissueThe tissue is not damaged by the procedure and is used for routine fixation and processing for histologic evaluationMajor advantages for intraoperative consultation are the avoidance of freezing (and freezing artifact), no potential loss of tissue, the rapid acquisition of digital images, and the possibility of remote diagnosis (telepathology)In addition to the following 3 methods described, additional methods in development include structured illumination microscopy, light sheet microscopy, microscopy using ultraviolet surface excitation (MUSE), and microscopy, as well as othersStimulated Raman Histology Simulated Raman histology (SRH) refers to high-resolution images closely resembling H&E sections created by contrast from the vibrational properties of molecules (lipids, proteins, nucleic acids) without the need for exogenous labelingDevices using this technology are commercially availableA major advantage is that no treatment of the tissue is required in order to obtain high-resolution subcellular detailThe tissue is placed into a special glass slide that lightly compresses the tissue to create a flat planeThe surface of the specimen is imaged as a flat planeImage acquisition requires ~ 2.5 minutesThe images are processed to render H&E-like pseudocoloringPathologists can interpret the images with minimal additional trainingOptical Coherence TomographyOptical coherence tomography (OCT) uses the detection of gated backscattered light arising from illuminated tissue to create a high-resolution, cross-sectional tomographic imageDevices using this technology are commercially availableNo pretreatment of the tissue is necessaryAn advantage to this technique is that there is greater tissue penetration (2-3 mm)However, there is lower resolution compared to other techniques: The images are in grayscale and primarily show structures rather than individual cellsA current application is for the evaluation of breast marginsMargins are imaged using slight compression with a glass plate to obtain a flat surfaceA region 10 x 10 cm in area and 2 mm in depth can be imaged in < 10 minutes to ~ 15- to 30-μm resolutionInterpretation requires special training because the images do not resemble conventional H&E slidesConfocal MicroscopyConfocal microscopy (CM) uses lasers of different wavelengths to detect tissue reflectance and block out-of-focus lightDevices using this technology are commercially availableThe area of the image varies with the device and ranges from 2-8 cmThe method measures fluorescence emitted from tissue, which can either be from endogenous autofluorescence or from the use of exogenous fluorescent dyesTreating the tissue with a fluorescent dye provides additional cellular detailStaining requires < 1 minuteThe surface of the specimen is imaged as a flat planeImage acquisition requires < 5 minutesThe images are processed to render H&E-like pseudocoloringPathologists can interpret the images with minimal additional trainingIN VIVO MICROSCOPY: PATIENTSOverviewSome of the methods used for ex vivo microscopy are being adapted for in vivo microscopyThese methods have the potential to provide the equivalent of high-resolution H&E microscopic images directly from tissue in patients and may eliminate or reduce the need to remove tissue for diagnosisPossible applications being explored include the followingCatheters: Lumina of ducts and blood vesselsLaparoscopic probes: Pleural and peritoneal surfacesEndoscopes: Gastrointestinal tract, lung, endometriumNeedle probes: Breast, liver, subcutaneous masses, many othersIngested capsules: Gastrointestinal tractTUMORS VISUALIZED USING FLUORESCENCEOverviewFluorescence-guided surgery uses the selective uptake &/or activation of dyes to identify tumorsPatients are injected with a fluorophore prior to surgeryIndocyanine green (ICG) is an FDA-approved imaging dye detected by near-infrared imagingAccumulates in tumor cells due to the abnormal neovasculatureLUM015 dye is activated by cathepsin to release an optically active fluorophore in areas of tumorProteases are more abundant in areas of the tumor microenvironmentLight sources in the operating room are used to excite and illuminate the fluorophorePenetration can be 1-2 cm when excitation wavelengths in the near infrared are usedPossible applications includeIdentification and excision of relatively superficial tumorsEvaluation of margins for residual tumorIdentification of unsuspected areas of disease (e.g., peritoneal metastases)Identification of sentinel nodes by injecting a fluorescent dye into lymphaticsFluorescence may be easier for the surgeon to identify compared to methylene blueFluorescence-Detecting Handheld ProbesProbes can be used by the surgeon to detect areas of fluorescence in the operative field and in excised specimensThis method may be most useful for the evaluation of margins after excisionFluorescence-Detecting Surgical GogglesSpecially designed augmented reality goggles allow surgeon to see areas of fluorescence within operative fieldThe hands-free operation may be superior for using this method intraoperativelyMARGINS EVALUATED USING SPECTROSCOPY-ENABLED HANDHELD PROBESOverviewSpectroscopy has been used to analyze tissue at the surfaces of specimens in order to determine if normal or abnormal tissue is presentCurrently marketed devices have been developed to specifically aid the surgeon in detecting cancer at the margins of breast excisionsMarginProbe Radiofrequency Spectroscopy System (Dune Medical Devices, Inc.)The probe measures local electrical properties in the radiofrequency range of breast tissue in order to distinguish benign and malignant tissueThe surgeon touches the probe to the outer surface of a breast specimenThe probe applies an electrical field to the tissue via a sensor at the tipA pneumatic system attaches the probe to the tissue and can only be used onceThe device provides a positive (malignant) or negative (benign) readout within secondsA specimen must be analyzed within 20 minutes after excision~ 5 minutes is required to scan an entire specimenMargins found to be positive can be reexcised in the same procedureIn order to have a high sensitivity to detect all carcinomas, the false-positive rate is ~ 30-50%ClearEdge (LS BioPath)This probe uses bioimpedance spectroscopy to distinguish normal from abnormal tissueThe surgeon touches the probe to the outer surface of a breast specimenThe device provides a normal (green or yellow) or abnormal (red) signal within secondsMargins found to have abnormal tissue can be reexcised in the same procedureTUMORS DIAGNOSED USING AEROSOLS GENERATED BY SURGICAL TOOLSOverviewMinute samples of disaggregated tissue can be identified as tumor or normal tissue using mass spectroscopy to analyze the chemical compositionThe tissue is destroyed during the process and thus cannot be evaluated using other methodsSurgical tools have been combined with probes that create and collect these samplesiKnife The iKnife (Medimass) is a surgical scalpel that provides information about the tissue it contactsElectrocautery from the iKnife creates an aerosol of tissueThe aerosol is aspirated and transferred by an air pump for analysis using rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS)An ML algorithm analyzes the data and provides a readout of positive (malignant) and negative (benign)The information can be provided to the surgeon immediately, either visually on a screen or via an audio signalThis method has been used to evaluate the margins of breast specimensCavitron Ultrasonic Surgical AspiratorTumors are dissected using ultrasonic tissue ablationThe resulting disaggregated tissue is analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy and has been used to identify tumor type, grade, and marginsThe analysis has been reported to be capable of identifying tumor type and gradeSpiderMassThis tool uses an infrared laser to excite water molecules for water-assisted laser desorption ionization (WALDI) mass spectroscopy analysisThe tip of the probe takes a small sample of the tissue (~ 0.1 mm)An advantage of this technique over the iKnife and Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA) is that the tissue is relatively undamagedThis allows the tool to be used to analyze the tissue composition of core needle biopsies to distinguish normal tissue from malignancy and areas of necrosisPotentially, it could also be used to evaluate other types of surgical specimensIn pilot studies, the analysis has been able to identify tumor type and gradeThis method could potentially be incorporated into a surgical tool that would provide real-time diagnostic information to the surgeon for diagnosis and margin evaluationLYMPH NODE METASTASES DETECTED USING RAPID REVERSE-TRANSCRIPTASE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTIONOverviewMetastatic carcinoma can be detected in lymph nodes by the presence of mRNA transcripts for proteins expressed by epithelial but not hematopoietic cellsIn the majority of cases, these cells are due to metastatic carcinoma; however, benign epithelial inclusions and contamination are also potential sourcesA rapid reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is used to determine the number of mRNA transcripts using a lysate from a lymph nodeIf the entire node is evaluated, the tissue is consumed in the process and cannot be evaluated using conventional pathologic evaluationThe majority of studies have evaluated axillary nodes for breast cancer, but the method is also being investigated for other types of carcinomaFS can not only detect carcinomas but also melanomas, lymphomas, infections, and other pathologic processes in lymph nodesIn contrast, RT-PCR can only detect cells with the target mRNAOne-Step Nucleic Acid AmplificationOne-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) is used in some centers to detect epithelial cells in lymph nodes by quantifying mRNA transcripts for CK19Both FS and OSNA are highly effective at detecting macrometastases (> 0.2 cm)OSNA detects more micrometastases, but the value of finding small metastases intraoperatively to guide axillary lymph node dissection is debatedThe use of OSNA to evaluate lymph nodes for other types of tumors is currently under investigationSTEATOSIS EVALUATED BY PHOTOGRAPHEvaluation of Livers Prior to TransplantationHepatic steatosis (HS) is associated with poor function and graft survival rate after transplantationDonor livers are currently evaluated by FS for HS as well as other findings that can alter graft functionIn one study, a photograph of a liver taken with a smartphone and donor data were analyzed by an ML algorithm to predict livers with > or < 30% HS as determined by FSDonor data included age, weight, height, liver enzymes, and liver/spleen attenuation ratio from a CT studyThe program was able to predict non-HS with a sensitivity of 97% and HS with a sensitivity of 93%Limitations of the study are the small number of livers evaluated and the inability to distinguish micro- from macrosteatosis as well as to detect other unfavorable histologic featuresAuthors suggest that this type of analysis could assist transplant surgeons in evaluating livers in a noninvasive manner and when pathologic assistance is not available",

            "raw_text": "INTRODUCTIONEx Vivo MicroscopyEx vivo microscopy (EVM) encompasses multiple methods used to obtain images from fresh tissue at microscopic resolution by analyzing reflected light of differing wavelengths2D and 3D images, either static or video, can be renderedSome methods use unprocessed tissue, whereas others treat the tissue with fluorescent dyesThe tissue is not altered by EVM and can be used for routine fixation and tissue processingEx vivo images are processed to render H&E-like pseudocoloringBy producing images similar to that of glass slides, pathologists can interpret EVM images without additional trainingThe same methods could potentially be modified for in vivo microscopy of tissue in patients and would reduce or eliminate the need for removal of tissuee.g., instead of performing a core needle biopsy, a probe could be placed into a lesion and an image acquired for diagnosisApplications for Ex Vivo Microscopy in PathologyThere are many specific attributes of EVM that provide new opportunities for pathologic evaluationRapid diagnosisSome EVM methods can acquire images in < 5 minutesRapid diagnosis has many applicationsIntraoperative diagnosis currently used at some centersSame-day diagnosis of rush biopsies or for outpatient procedures (e.g., skin or breast biopsies)Determination of tissue adequacy for some procedures (e.g., renal biopsies)Helpful for selection of optimal samples for tissue bankingDirect acquisition of digital imagesDigital imaging facilitates the use of telepathologye.g., images can be viewed remotely to provide subspecialty opinion in locations without specific expertiseImages can be used to develop artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) methodsAI/ML programs are being investigated for use in the diagnosis and evaluation of prognostic and predictive markersDigital images have advantages for archival storage and retrievalLarger areas of tissue can be imagedSome methods can image areas of tissue up to 8 cmLarge microscopic images can provide additional information for the evaluation of specimens that are not always available with conventional glass slidesSizes of larger tumorsRelationships among multiple tumorsDistance to marginsThese images also could be used to guide block selection for optimal specimen gross evaluation and sampling3D imagingThe capacity to see tissue in 3D at a microscopic resolution provides information not previously available by gross or conventional microscopic evaluationCould be helpful for the evaluation of margins, particularly when complex structures are involved, such as the ductal system of the breastPotential Disadvantages of Ex Vivo MicroscopyEVM requires special equipment and additional training and increases costThe optimal platform for clinical use has not yet been determined (many are currently under development)In some methods, the images are of the surface of the specimenObtaining images at deeper levels is more challengingFine microtome sectioning of tissue for conventional levels may have advantages for the evaluation of very small lesionsArtifacts specific to the method used may be introducedLong-term storage of large digital files is problematic for many institutionsHow to incorporate immediate viewing of images into a routine pathology workflow to take advantage of rapid diagnostic capacity is unclearCombining digital ex vivo images with conventional glass slides into the patient's medical record may be challengingTYPES OF EX VIVO IMAGINGMethodsNumerous methods are currently under investigationSome methods are becoming commercially available, whereas others are in early developmentMethods vary with the need to treat the tissue prior to imaging, the size of the tissue that can be imaged, the depth of imaging, and the time required to obtain an imageMethods requiring staining with dyes may be limited for in vivo applicationsIn general, the methods do not alter the tissue, thus it can be used for routine fixation, tissue processing, staining, immunohistochemistry, and other techniquesStimulated Raman HistologyStimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy uses contrast created by vibrational properties of molecules within tissue (lipids, proteins, nucleic acids) to allow label-free optical sectioningAn optical imaging process employing fiber-laser scattering microscopy to create a rapid, high-resolution image from fresh tissue, closely resembling an H&E section, is termed stimulated Raman histology (SRH)A major advantage of this method is the ability to produce high-resolution images without the use of dyesImages are generally limited to the surface of the specimenDue to its ability to rapidly process brain tissue without damage, SRH has emerged as a leading technology for EVM of brain tissuesFluorescence Confocal MicroscopyFluorescence confocal microscopy (FCM) is a technique utilizing excitation of exogenous fluorophores (fluorescent dyes) that label nuclei to generate image contrastThe tissue is treated with a fluorescent dye to improve the recognition of cells and tissue architectureLarge tissue sections up to 8 cm can be imagedImages are generally limited to the surface of the specimenStructured Illumination MicroscopyStructured illumination microscopy (SIM) is an optimal sectioning microscopy process using patterned fluorescence excitationTissues are treated with a fluorescent dye; large specimens are able to be imagedImages are generally limited to the surface of the specimenNonlinear MicroscopyNonlinear microscopy (NLM) is multiphoton, 2-photon, and 2nd-harmonic generation microscopyTissues are treated with a fluorescent dyeCan image specimens to a depth of 100 μmOptical Coherence TomographyOptical coherence tomography (OCT) uses detection of a gated, backscattered light arising from illuminated tissue to create a high-resolution, cross-sectional tomographic imageCan be performed on untreated tissue without labelingCan image specimens to a depth of 2-3 mmThis capability is useful for evaluating specimen marginsThe lower resolution limits the utility for primary diagnosis but may be adequate for specific purposes, such as evaluating the margins of breast specimensThe images are grayscale and do not resemble conventional H&E slides; special training is required for interpretationLight Sheet MicroscopyLight sheet microscopy (LSM) is optical sectioning microscopy that removes out-of-focus light using a thin selective Illumination plane that generates fluorescence signals to be imagedRequires treatment of the tissue with fluorescent dyes3D volumetric imaging is possible for fresh or fixed tissue but requires tissue clearingCan reveal architectural aspects of pathologic processes not evident using conventional 2D imagesMicroscopy Using Ultraviolet Surface ExcitationOptical sectioning microscopy using ultraviolet surface excitation (MUSE) of tissueRequires treatment of the tissue with fluorescent dyesLarge specimens can be imagedCan image specimens to a depth of 1-10 μmEX VIVO MICROSCOPY FOR INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATIONGross Examination and Tissue PreparationThe following protocol is an example of how an EVM system using SRH is being used for intraoperative assessment of neurosurgical specimensThe portable EVM system is located in the ORThe device is about the size of a cryostat but is mounted on wheels and can easily be movedThe tissue biopsy is removed by the surgeonThe preferred size of tissue is ≤ 0.3 cm in the greatest dimension for optimal imaging

viewed in the OR on the docked screenA digital touch screen is used to zoom and scan the tissue image; acquisition of the image requires ~ 2.5 minutesEvaluation of ImagesThe pathologist can view the

            "raw_text": "THE ART OF INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATIONMore Than Pathology at High SpeedThere are significant differences compared to general pathology practiceThe major purpose of intraoperative consultation (IOC) is to answer a specific question required for directing surgeryThe diagnosis has an immediate impact on the care of the patientA definitive diagnosis is generally not necessary or optimalInformation should be limited to that essential for immediate management of the patientThe majority of special studies are not available; diagnosis is based almost exclusively on H&E slidesOnly limited sampling of large specimens is possible within time limitsA judicious interpretation of the findings is often necessary given the limitation of frozen sectionsA conservative approach, but not too conservative, is appropriateDegrees of uncertainty when a definitive diagnosis is not possible may need to be shared with the surgeonIOC is time limitedIdeally, an answer is available to the surgeon within 20 minutesTakes precedence over all other activitiesIn most institutions, a pathologist is available on call for IOC at all timesDirect interaction between the pathologist and surgeon is preferredPrecise oral and written communication is essentialOften occurs at a site distant from the pathology departmentPathologists typically prefer using their own microscope in their own workspaceDoes not occur at a predetermined timeMay be requested at times outside normal working hours (e.g., nights and weekends)Reference material may be limited or difficult to access (e.g., books and journals)Online references can be available at any site with computer accessConsultation with colleagues is often not possibleNot subspecialized; pathologists often see specimens outside their areas of expertiseThe pathologist is a patient advocate during IOCShould only comply with requests for frozen section when they are in the best interest of the patientShould request additional biopsies when received material is not sufficient for diagnosisMust ensure that tissue is used 1st for diagnosis and clinical care and only 2nd for investigational studies and other usesExpertise is primarily acquired performing IOCsRequires long years of experience, many close calls, and a few errorsMore difficult to teach using books or lectures compared to other areas of pathology\"Pearls of experience\" are suggestions and advicePearls start as a grain of sand but gain value over timeLearning from errors is an excellent method to improve practice (especially when the errors are not yours)Goals of Intraoperative ConsultationThere are 3 principal reasons for immediate microscopic evaluation of specimens(1) Diagnosis to guide intra- or perioperative patient managementIdentification or confirmation of a pathologic processEvaluation of margins for a known malignancy(2) Confirmation of sufficient lesional tissue for eventual definitive diagnosisA definitive diagnosis is not always necessary during the operationThe pathologist confirms to the surgeon there is no need to remove additional tissueThis may avoid additional morbidity for the patient(3) Optimal processing of tissue for ancillary studies to be used for diagnosis, treatment, or researchOften important for lymphomas, sarcomas, and pediatric tumorsOther tumors requiring special handlingMost Common Diagnostic QuestionsDiagnosis of primary lesion (~ 20%)In many cases, preoperative diagnosis is possible using needle or endoscopic biopsiesIn some cases, a prior attempt may have been unsuccessful or contraindicated due to the location or type of lesionA definitive diagnosis need only be provided when relevant to immediate patient managementOften benign vs. malignant is sufficient for IOCHowever, for difficult cases, a deferred diagnosis is better than a wrong diagnosis that could lead to unnecessary surgeryEvaluation of margins for a known malignant tumor (~ 40%)Additional tissue may be taken to achieve negative margins in a single procedureAccuracy is generally very highIdentification of lymph node metastasis (~ 20%)Resection with curative intent may be canceled if metastatic disease is identifiedAdditional nodes may not need to be sampledPatients may be treated with systemic therapy prior to definitive resectionIf a positive sentinel node is identified, additional nodes may be excisedAdequacy of tissue for future diagnosis (~ 5%)In some cases, a definitive diagnosis during IOC is unnecessaryHowever, sufficient tissue must be obtained for an eventual diagnosisIf tissue is difficult to obtain, it is important to avoid the need for a 2nd invasive procedureA provisional diagnosis can aid in the allocation of tissue for ancillary studiesAncillary studies may be required for the final diagnosisTypically, lymphomas, small round blue cell tumors, and soft tissue tumorsFresh tissue may also be desirable for special studies to identify cellular constituents vulnerable to targeted therapyPatients may also consent to have tissue taken for tumor banksPathologists must request additional tissue when appropriateEvaluation of organ prior to transplant (< 5%)The scarcity of organs has resulted in the donor pool being expanded to include donors with possibly marginally functional organsIOC is important to avoid transplantation of organs with a high likelihood of failureEvaluation of organs prior to transplant can reduce poor outcomesChanges in Intraoperative Consultation Over TimeThe need for IOC changes as the treatment of patients changesConsultations becoming more commonEvaluation of lung lesions detected by screeningMore patients are undergoing screening for lung cancerLesions detected by screening are typically small or of low density (ground glass)Lesions can be difficult or impossible for the surgeon to palpateSpecial localization techniques may be requiredMore limited surgery may be considered for adenocarcinoma in situ or minimally invasive adenocarcinomaEvaluation of margins of partial nephrectomiesIncreased efforts are being made to preserve renal function to avoid the need for dialysisRadioactive seed retrievalRetrieval in the IOC room may be preferred to ensure all seeds are identified, documented, and stored until they can be disposed of safelyNipple margin of mastectomiesNipple-sparing mastectomies are increasingly used for breast cancer treatmentThe base of the nipple may be examined intraoperatively with removal of the nipple when carcinoma is detectedEvaluation of organs prior to transplantConsultations currently rarely performed Identification of parathyroid adenomasIntraoperative measurement of parathyroid hormone level is a useful functional assay that is used to guide surgerySentinel node evaluation for breast carcinomaStudies have shown good outcomes for carefully selected women with positive sentinel nodes without axillary dissectionIOC evaluation is unnecessary if the result will not alter the surgical planPrimary diagnosis of breast lesionsCore needle biopsies are highly accurate and allow decisions to be made concerning choice of surgery and systemic therapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant)Definitive surgery can be planned based on the core needle biopsy diagnosisLimitationsFrozen sections are not equivalent to the evaluation of specimens on permanent sectionsDiagnoses on frozen section should be limited to the information needed for intraoperative management of patientSamplingTissue sections must be small to freeze well and quicklyThe amount of tissue examined is less than that examined by permanent sectionsPearl of experience: The pathologist evaluating microscopic slides should always perform, or be aware of, the gross findingsIf macroscopic and microscopic findings are not compatible, an error should be consideredA good gross examination is often more accurate than a suboptimal microscopic sectionFor example, ink can often leak into specimens or smear, making it difficult to identify the true marginIce crystal artifactFreezing introduces permanent changes in tissues by disrupting cell membranes and other structuresAlthough artifact can be minimized by rapid freezing of small samples, it is usually presentArtifacts can make diagnosis difficult or even impossible in extreme casesNuclei can look larger and more variable in size and shapeHoles in tissue can mimic intracellular vacuoles or fatTissue should only be frozen if the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of compromising eventual diagnosisPearl of experience: Nonpathologists often do not understand that patients can be harmed by inappropriate freezing of tissue due to artifacts permanently introducedThis fact can be helpful as part of an explanation as to why a frozen section should not be performedTechnical issuesSome tissues (e.g., adipose tissue) do not freeze wellTissues may be cut thicklyTissue folds can complicate interpretationAbsence of special studiesHistochemical and immunohistochemical studies are generally not availableSome diagnoses require additional studiesInappropriate Intraoperative ConsultationsIf IOC is requested but the information is not needed for intraoperative or immediate perioperative patient management, the request may be inappropriateInappropriate IOC wastes valuable resources and timeCould delay appropriate IOC for other patientsGenerates unnecessary medical costMay compromise the ultimate diagnosisIOC unnecessary and potentially harmful to the patientCompletely freezing any lesion may preclude the ultimate definitive diagnosisFreezing artifact can obscure diagnostic featuresTissue loss can occur during sectioning in cryostatPigmented lesions of skin and small breast lesions should never be entirely frozenThese lesions should be diagnosed and features evaluated on optimal permanent sectionsFreezing artifact and potential loss of tissue can preclude making a definitive diagnosisThe pathologist must be an advocate for the patientThe surgeon must be informed as to why freezing the entire lesion could be harmful to the patientAlternatives can be discussed, such as expedited processing of permanent sectionsPearl of experience: There are rare occasions in which unusual requests for IOC are appropriateRather than refusing to do a frozen section, it can be more helpful to ask the surgeon how the examination would benefit the patientThe pathologist and surgeon can reach an agreement about the best course of actionUltimately, the pathologist must act in the best interest of the patientIOC unnecessary but not harmful to the patientThere is usually no need for frozen section diagnosis on a large tumor that has been completely excisedHowever, performing a frozen section on a small portion of tumor will not interfere with the eventual diagnosisThe surgeon may request IOC to provide information to the patient or familyThe request should be discussed with the surgeon to determine how intraoperative or immediate postoperative management would be changed by a diagnosisIf there would be no change, then discuss why frozen section is unnecessaryIn some cases, there may be clinical indications for a diagnosis of which the pathologist is not awarePearl of experience: It can be difficult to discuss departmental policy concerning inappropriate IOCs with a surgeon while the patient is under anesthesiaIf inappropriate (but not harmful) requests are a recurring problem, departmental and institutional policies should be developed by surgeons and pathologists and discussed in a multidisciplinary settingIOCs known to have low sensitivity or specificityThe value of performing a frozen section may be very low in some situationsEvaluation of follicular thyroid lesions for capsular invasionEvaluation of margins of large breast excisionsThe surgeon should be aware of the likelihood of a change in diagnosis on permanent sectionsDepartmental and institutional policies should be developed for evaluating these types of specimensPATIENT HISTORYPrior to Intraoperative ConsultationKnowledge about the clinical setting helps establish a safety net for the patientA substantial number of errors occur because the pathologist interprets a specimen without adequate informationEspecially helpful in some situationsBiopsies of mediastinal lymph nodes (important to know if for tumor staging or to evaluate lymphadenopathy)Determines if the entire specimen should be frozen or only a representative portionResections after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapyChanges in normal cells due to treatment can be mistaken for malignancyRare tumor typesTumors for which imaging appearance is critical for final diagnosis (central nervous system tumors, bone tumors)Pearl of experience: Reviewing clinical histories prior to IOC leads to faster and more confident diagnoses and considerably less anxietySome people believe that pathologists should be able to divine all clinical information from surgical specimens as the haruspices in ancient Rome were able to divine information from examining organs; this is not trueIOC requiring the allocation of tissue for purposes beyond diagnosis must be identifiedTissue required for patient treatment should be distinguished from tissue requested for researchPatients may require tissue sampling to be eligible for clinical trialsSpecial procedures may be requiredSterile tissue is necessary for cell cultures (e.g., vaccine studies)Warm ischemia time (in operating room) and cold ischemia time (until tissue is frozen or placed in fixative should be minimized)Rapid freezing is required for the preservation of some unstable biomoleculesPatient care must always take precedence over use of tissue for research that does not directly impact patientObtaining information prior to IOC is preferable, when possibleDoes not extend the time of the IOC while the patient is under anesthesiaAllows time to review prior pathology or imaging studies when availableWell-designed electronic medical records can facilitate obtaining key information prior to the operationImportant

specimen is not immediately clear, it is an unusual case, and the best course of action is to contact the surgeonInformation obtained during IOCIf information is obtained from the surgeon that is helpful for the interpretation of the frozen section, this will also be helpful for the final diagnosisInformation should be recorded on the requisition form and available to the pathologist reviewing the case for final sign outInformation obtained in operating roomIn some institutions, it may be possible for the pathologist to directly observe the operative field and to discuss the case face-to-face with the surgeonREPORTING RESULTSWritten ReportThe diagnosis is written and signed by the attending pathologistMost laboratories have a specific form for this purposeThe form should be labeled with the patient name, medical record number, and surgical pathology numberThe specific specimen and subdesignation for the frozen section are includedThe diagnosis should directly address the question posed by the surgeon to successfully complete the operationPearl of experience: Diagnoses should be brief and include only the information necessary (e.g., \"no tumor present\" or \"metastatic cancer present\")Long and wordy reports are difficult to communicate orally and more likely to be misunderstoodAvoid using abbreviationsAn abbreviation saves time for 1 person and aggravates everyone elseAbbreviations may vary among specialties and may be misunderstoodFor example, pathologists understand \"c/w\" to mean \"consistent with,\" whereas radiologists understand \"c/w\" to mean \"compared with\"Superfluous information (typically histologic type or grade) is unnecessary and can create potential discrepancies with the final diagnosisPearl of experience: It is critical to know the consequences of a diagnosis (e.g., surgery for potential cure terminated or continued) when making diagnostic judgment calls when a definitive diagnosis is not obviousThe harm of a false-negative vs. a false-positive diagnosis for a patient is often not equivalentFalse-negative diagnoses are more common than false-positive diagnosesPathologists are generally conservative and require obvious features of malignancy before making a diagnosis on frozen sectionWritten reports of IOC as part of the final pathology report are typically not available to the patient's caregivers for daysWhen possible, documentation of the IOC in a manner that is available immediately in the patient's record is preferableIn electronic medical records, this may be possible using a hold note or as a report separate from the final pathology reportOral ReportThe final diagnosis is called back to the operating roomIt is preferable to read the written report exactlyIf not the surgeon, the person receiving the information should write it down and read the diagnosis back to the pathologistWhen possible, information should be relayed directly to the surgeonPearl of experience: Complex or unusual diagnoses are best communicated directly between the pathologist and surgeonThere is a high rate of miscommunication when the diagnosis is other than \"benign\" or \"malignant\"Reports that include terms indicating degrees of certainty (e.g., \"suspicious for,\" \"cannot exclude,\" \"atypical\") can be interpreted differently by the pathologist and surgeonSimilar terms (e.g., \"carcinoid\" and \"carcinoma\") must be clearly distinguishedTHE FUTUREEx Vivo MicroscopyNew techniques are able to derive microscopic detail from fresh tissueEx vivo microscopy is currently being used for IOC in some centersIt is possible that these techniques will be developed for in-vivo microscopy either in the operative field or via probes placed in tissuesArtificial IntelligenceMachine-learning computer programs are being used to analyze images for pathologic diagnosisArtificial intelligence (AI) could be used to assist pathologists for difficult cases &/or to provide services when a pathologist is not availableEither digitized images of glass slides or the images generated by ex vivo microscopy can be usedTelepathologyMany pathologists became more experienced with the use of telepathology for diagnosis during the COVID pandemicIt is likely telepathology will be used more widely in the future to broaden the number of pathologists who can provide IOC services",

            "raw_text": "INTRODUCTIONQuality AssessmentSuccessful rendering of an intraoperative consultation (IOC) requires a complex series of stepsEach institution needs to develop best practices for patient safety and care efficiencyThe Association of Directors of Anatomic and Surgical Pathology (ADASP) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) have issued recommendations for quality assurance (QA) and benchmarks for performanceELEMENTS OF QUALITY IMPROVEMENTQuality Improvement PlanMission statement: Clear statement of goalsIOCs offer patients the best care and minimize the possibility of errorMechanisms to detect errors are utilizedErrors are used as a means to educate practitioners and to improve the system to enhance accuracyAll elements of the test cycle are addressedPreanalytic, analytic, and postanalyticPriorities are set for targeting resources and efforts to best effectThe program complies with regulatory requirementsAppropriate internal and external benchmarks are utilizedUses data tracking to develop strategies for error reduction and preventionOperational Elements Contributing to High-Quality ServiceDiagnostic capability should be appropriate to the clinical settingAdequate expertise to handle institutional case complexityPeer consultation availabilitySubspecialist consultation &/or subspecialty call service if appropriateSufficient assigned pathologists to handle volumeAvailability of pathologist appropriate to clinical settingMay be provided at all times and every day in large hospitalsMay be prearranged by request for specific types of surgery in small community hospitals or surgicentersPhysical work environmentAdequate space, lighting, and ventilationTracking log to document receipt of all specimensWell-maintained cryostats and staining stationsWell-maintained microscopesPreferably with ability to share images with consultants, trainees, &/or clinicians via multiple heads, telepathology, or digital scanningProximity of special media, equipment (e.g., snap freezing), specimen containers, and requisition slips for ancillary studiesAvailability of printed and online resources for information related to IOCTelephone, intercoms, or other means to communicate with operating room staffClinical staffCompetent, accountable, and expeditious courier serviceTime spent in transferring specimens for IOC should be minimizedMedical/nursing staff provide accurate and sufficient information on requisition slipsInadequate information is detrimental for patient careIncreases likelihood of errors in sampling and interpretationMay delay diagnosis while additional information is soughtQUALITY ASSURANCE MONITORS AND REPORTINGVolume StatisticsMay be general or subcategorized by specimen typeRequired to determine quality indicators per specimenTurnaround TimeDefined as the time from delivery of specimen to IOC room to the time diagnosis is communicated to the surgeonThese times should be documented in a defined manner (e.g., in specimen tracking log, IOC report, separate QA database)Traditionally, the expected turnaround time (TAT) is < 20 minutes for a routine single-block specimen received by itself with no other concurrent specimens90% of IOCs can typically be performed during this length of timeCAP checklist no longer stipulates a threshold for accreditation purposesTAT perceived by the surgeon is the time that the specimen leaves the operating room to the time that he/she receives the diagnosisIt may be of value to monitor the transit time from the operating room to the IOC room (preanalytic variable)Case ReviewIOCs are periodically reviewedDiscrepant and deferred cases are detectedStatistics on performance are calculatedReport should be available &/or presented to departmentFollow-up on issues indicating system problems or need for peer review is part of the processADASP RecommendationAll IOCs should be reviewed on a regular basis and classified into the following categoriesAgreement (no discrepancy between intraoperative and final diagnosis)Disagreement: MinorDisagreement: MajorDeferral: AppropriateDeferral: InappropriateCases in \"Disagreement: Major\" and \"Deferral: Inappropriate\" categories should be further classified according to the source of the problem and to the severity of likely medical consequencesModifications of this schema have been proposed, e.g., defining minor vs. major errors solely in terms of risk for minor or major clinical significanceERRORSError Detection and ClassificationAll IOC diagnoses should be reviewed at the time of final diagnosis; in cases or potential discrepancy, the frozen section slides or IOC cytology preparations themselves should be reviewedIf the entire specimen was used for frozen section, the intraoperatively prepared frozen section slides should be reviewed for final diagnosisAny discordant findings should be investigated and reportedInterpretive error: Findings present on slides used for IOC but not reportedBlock sampling error: Findings not present on slides used for IOC but present in deeper levels on permanent sectionSome errors due to failure to sample the lesion are preventableRepresentative sections of all tissue fragments should be present on frozen section slidesExhaustive sampling of small specimens representing margins in cases with established primary tumor diagnosis may prevent false-negativesFailure to detect a lesion smaller than a tissue section (~ < 2-3 mm) will occur in some casesBecause it is impossible to detect all such minute lesions, it may not be appropriate to consider this an errorGross sampling error: Findings not present on slides used for IOC or on deeper levels but present in other sections of specimenIf a lesion is suspected preoperatively but not seen, additional sampling of the specimen is often of valueIn general, a lymph node being evaluated for IOC staging should be entirely frozen unless a grossly evident metastasis is presentIf a change in the IOC diagnosis will affect patient care, the surgeon should be notified immediately, and notification should be documented in the final pathology reportSuch notifications should be addressed by department policy regarding significant and unexpected findings in anatomic pathologySources of ErrorPreanalyticIncorrect case or patient identificationIncorrect site identification (e.g., proximal vs. distal resection margin)Inadequate clinical informationFailure to notify of prior diagnosis of malignancyFailure to provide information about prior therapyAdjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapyPurpose for IOC unclear or inappropriateAnalyticSamplingGross (lesion not selected for frozen section or cytologic preparation)Block (lesion present but not seen on prepared slides)TechnicalPoor freezing, cutting, or staining technique interferes with interpretationTissue lost during processingSlides mislabeledInterpretationChange in category (benign vs. malignant)Change within category (type of malignancy)Change in threshold (grade or stage)e.g., atypical ductal hyperplasia vs. ductal carcinoma in situ of breast, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia vs. adenocarcinoma in situ of lungChange in lymph node statusChange in margin statusPostanalyticThe diagnosis is not communicated to the surgeonAn incorrect diagnosis is communicated to the surgeonThe surgeon has an understanding of the reported diagnosis different from that of the pathologistClassification by ConsequencesADASP recommends classifying errors according to the severity of medical consequencesNo clinical significanceMinor or questionable clinical significanceMajor or potentially major clinical significanceSome QA systems classify according to actual rather than potential harmAt philosophical discretion of institution, but this should be defined in quality improvement planDEFERRED DIAGNOSESDefinitionIn a very broad sense, all IOC diagnoses are deferred to the final diagnosis on permanent sectionsFor QA purposes, the diagnosis is defined as deferred when no diagnosis can be renderedShould be reserved for cases in which information requested cannot be provided using the specimen providedTypically, < 5% of IOCs are deferred but may vary by specimen typee.g., deferrals are common for follicular lesions of the thyroidTypesThere are 5 major sources of deferred diagnosesDifficult to classify lesions: Definitive diagnosis (i.e., benign vs. malignant) may not be possible for some specimens submitted for IOCCommon examplesPancreatic adenocarcinoma vs. chronic pancreatitisLepidic pattern adenocarcinoma vs. reactive changes in lungResidual/recurrent squamous cell carcinoma vs. radiation-induced atypia in squamous metaplasiaDeferral is appropriate if sufficient diagnostic features are not presentThe number of appropriately deferred cases is a measure of the number of very difficult cases encountered in IOCDeferral is inappropriate if, on QA review of frozen section, diagnosis is deemed to be (reasonably) possibleThe number of inappropriately deferred cases is a measure of knowledge base/experience of pathologistsCorrective measure: Review diagnostic features with the pathologistProvide literature and online resources with diagnostic criteria that are readily accessible in the IOC roomConsider methods to facilitate 2nd opinions for difficult cases (e.g., telepathology)Biopsy-induced artifacts: Extensive crushing &/or cautery can cause tissue damage that precludes interpretationDeferral appropriate for severely damaged specimensNumber of deferred cases is a measure of surgical ability to provide high-quality specimensCorrective measure: Explore alternative methods (e.g., cutting needle vs. pinching forceps &/or excision without cautery for diagnostic biopsies submitted for IOC)Some tumors, notably small cell carcinoma, are friable and very difficult to biopsy without significant artifactArtifacts or tissue loss due to pathology processing: Poor selection of tissue (e.g., freezing large fatty fragments &/or wet tissue), poor cutting technique (e.g., thick, wrinkled sections), poor staining (e.g., contamination of stains with xylene), and loss of tissue in cryostat may preclude interpretationWhen feasible and appropriate, additional tissue should be frozen or an additional biopsy should be requested from surgeonDeferral is not appropriate if a better technique would have yielded an interpretable slideThe number of deferred cases is a measure of the capacity of pathology personnel to produce high-quality slidesCorrective measure: Review appropriate preparation of frozen sections slides with pathology personnelSpecimens not amenable to frozen section or cytologic examination: It may not be possible to evaluate fatty tissue or heavily calcified specimens, such as boneDeferral is appropriate if tissue cannot be examinedThe number of deferred cases is a measure of the number of cases that are submitted for IOC that cannot be examinedCorrective measure: Surgeons can be informed about types of specimens that cannot be evaluated by IOCRemember that some specimens not amenable to cryostat sectioning can be interpreted using intraoperative cytology preparationsLack of sufficient clinical information for evaluation: In some cases, clinical information is essential to provide diagnosisCommon examplesBrain and bone lesion evaluation requires information about imaging findingsInformation about prior radiation or chemotherapy is necessary to determine if cells with atypia are more likely malignant or due to treatment-induced changesThyroid follicles associated with lymphocytes and germinal centers could be metastatic carcinoma to a lymph node or an area of nodular lymphocytic thyroiditis, depending on history of malignancy and location of noduleDeferral is appropriate if information cannot or is not provided by the surgeon or is unavailable in the system (e.g., electronic medical record)The number of deferred cases is a measure of cases without essential clinical informationCorrective measure: Surgeons are informed of information needed by the pathologist for IOCReview of hospital &/or laboratory information system for patients with scheduled operations likely to generate IOC can be helpfulCases Not Considered DeferredIn some situations, definitive diagnosis is not provided, but the case should not be considered deferred for QA purposesProvisional diagnosis: In many cases, it is appropriate to provide some diagnostic information on IOC, but the final diagnosis is best made after evaluation of permanent sections and possible ancillary studiesCommon examplesSpindle cell neoplasmLymphoproliferative disorderEncapsulated follicular neoplasm of thyroidLesional tissue presentThe goal of IOC is to provide optimum intraprocedural patient and specimen management; in this pursuit, a correct but less specific diagnosis is better than an incorrect but more specific diagnosis, i.e., \"diagnostic minimalism\" is appropriateThe number of such cases should not be used as a measure of quality of IOCCanceled diagnosis: In some cases, IOC may be requested that is considered inappropriate or unnecessary by the pathologistPathologist should discuss the case with the surgeon to come to a decision to cancel requestThis should be considered a canceled request and not a deferred diagnosisBENCHMARKSStudies of General AccuracyOverall accuracy generally in 90-98% range across specimen types in large studiesFalse-negatives are much more frequent (~ 7x) than false-positivesSampling error is more common than interpretive errorAccuracy is generally higher for more narrowly defined (e.g., margin assessment of known malignancy) than general (\"what is this mass\") questionsADASP BenchmarksRecommendations for maximum acceptable ratesDisagreement: Major cases = 3%Deferral: Inappropriate cases = 10%Variables Affecting AccuracyIncidence of target lesion in populationIf true positives are rare, even studies with low sensitivity may have high negative predictive valueReason for IOCDefined question, such as margin positivity of known cancer type, may yield accuracy approaching 100%Accuracy of primary diagnosis of unknown tumor type is closer to 80%Inclusion or exclusion of lesions is difficult to diagnose on frozen sectionNoninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear featuresPaget disease of vulvaSkin margins for melanomaPrimary diagnosis of Hirschsprung diseaseInclusion or exclusion of small lesions is difficult or impossible to reliably detect by frozen sectionMicropapillary carcinoma of thyroidMicrometastases or isolated tumor cells in sentinel nodes for breast cancerInclusion or exclusion of deferred casesDefinition of \"deferred\" diagnosis variesExclusion of these cases reduces total number of cases and, therefore, increases error rateSite-Specific AccuracyAccuracy is variable according to the types of cases includedFor specialty hospitals and centers of excellence, it may be appropriate to set specimen-specific benchmarks for reportingPositive/negative predictive value of IOC by specimen type often has more clinical utility than sensitivity/specificity/accuracy, e.g., SLN sampling in breast cancerSTRATEGIES TO PREVENT ERRORClinical InformationPreoperative conferences for complex cases heavily reliant on clinical or imaging information (e.g., orthopedic tumors) are very usefulEnsure surgeons are aware of information that can alter IOC interpretationUtilize medical records, when possible, to obtain essential information prior to IOCRequest additional information from the surgeon if the reason for IOC is unclear or if unusual findings are encounteredPatient IdentificationUse of 2 identifiers on specimen and slide labelsRead back of patient identification by operating room team [Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) requirement]Accession case with laboratory ID number as early as possible in handling processAll paperwork, slides, and specimen containers must be labeledSamplingCareful gross examination and sectioning of mass lesions are essentialAdditional sampling of gross specimen or block is appropriate when only limited lesion is present for evaluation on slideBeware of secondary processes, such as scar, abscess, and granulomataSampling from edge of malignancy may only reveal reactive changesExamples of site-specific strategies to improve samplingAdditional gross or microscopic sectioning of lung granulomas and scarsAdditional sampling of large ovarian/adnexal masses, particularly mucinous tumorsIf malignancy is not seen on initial sections, attending pathologist should reexamine gross specimenComplete exhaustion of negative tissue margins in skin excisionsSubmission by surgeon of en face margins distinct from resection specimen for complex anatomic specimens (e.g., pancreatic duct margin, head and neck mucosal excisions)If the diagnosis is not possible, request additional samples from the surgeon if feasible or defer the diagnosis if notInterpretationCases appropriate for IOC should be determined by institutionInappropriate requests can be harmful to patients and may be more prone to errore.g., small primary lesions should not be completely frozen for diagnosisPreview of scheduled cases, including review of any available prior slides for comparison, is helpfulUse cytology preparations as adjunct to conventional frozen sectionsUse of differential diagnosis lists; a diagnosis not considered cannot be madeHave relevant resources with information about IOC readily availableConsideration of metastatic disease, particularly in \"sump\" organs (lung, liver, brain)Pathologist should be aware of clinical consequence of diagnosisIn some cases, a false-negative diagnosis may cause less patient harm than a false-positive diagnosisCommunication about the degree of diagnosis certainty may be helpful to the surgeonFalse-negative diagnoses are more common than false-positive diagnosesPathologists tend to be conservativeSpecific criteria for malignancy can be helpful (e.g., for pancreatic carcinoma)Obtain 2nd opinion, when possible, on site or via telepathologyGeneral \"2nd eye\" or use of pathologist \"hospitalist\" who specializes in intraprocedural evaluationSubspecialist expertiseMay be ad hoc or institutional policy for certain case types, e.g., brain tumors, donor organs for transplantationTechnical FactorsMake sure cryostats are working at the beginning of the day by cutting the test slideEnsure all personnel using cryostats and stain lines are adequately trainedDo not hesitate to cut additional sections if tissue folds or holes make interpretation difficultCommunicationReporting diagnoses by telephone or intercom should follow recommended proceduresConfirm patient identityIdentify the pathologist rendering the diagnosisIdentify the operating room team member receiving the reportState the findings in the clearest terms possible; engage the surgeon in discussion or have a member of the surgical team acknowledge any ambiguous findingsAvoid unnecessarily wordy diagnostic textBe aware that qualifiers, such as \"favor\" or \"suspicious,\" may be (are often)

              "DEFERRED DIAGNOSES": "DefinitionIn a very broad sense, all IOC diagnoses are deferred to the final diagnosis on permanent sectionsFor QA purposes, the diagnosis is defined as deferred when no diagnosis can be renderedShould be reserved for cases in which information requested cannot be provided using the specimen providedTypically, < 5% of IOCs are deferred but may vary by specimen typee.g., deferrals are common for follicular lesions of the thyroidTypesThere are 5 major sources of deferred diagnosesDifficult to classify lesions: Definitive diagnosis (i.e., benign vs. malignant) may not be possible for some specimens submitted for IOCCommon examplesPancreatic adenocarcinoma vs. chronic pancreatitisLepidic pattern adenocarcinoma vs. reactive changes in lungResidual/recurrent squamous cell carcinoma vs. radiation-induced atypia in squamous metaplasiaDeferral is appropriate if sufficient diagnostic features are not presentThe number of appropriately deferred cases is a measure of the number of very difficult cases encountered in IOCDeferral is inappropriate if, on QA review of frozen section, diagnosis is deemed to be (reasonably) possibleThe number of inappropriately deferred cases is a measure of knowledge base/experience of pathologistsCorrective measure: Review diagnostic features with the pathologistProvide literature and online resources with diagnostic criteria that are readily accessible in the IOC roomConsider methods to facilitate 2nd opinions for difficult cases (e.g., telepathology)Biopsy-induced artifacts: Extensive crushing &/or cautery can cause tissue damage that precludes interpretationDeferral appropriate for severely damaged specimensNumber of deferred cases is a measure of surgical ability to provide high-quality specimensCorrective measure: Explore alternative methods (e.g., cutting needle vs. pinching forceps &/or excision without cautery for diagnostic biopsies submitted for IOC)Some tumors, notably small cell carcinoma, are friable and very difficult to biopsy without significant artifactArtifacts or tissue loss due to pathology processing: Poor selection of tissue (e.g., freezing large fatty fragments &/or wet tissue), poor cutting technique (e.g., thick, wrinkled sections), poor staining (e.g., contamination of stains with xylene), and loss of tissue in cryostat may preclude interpretationWhen feasible and appropriate, additional tissue should be frozen or an additional biopsy should be requested from surgeonDeferral is not appropriate if a better technique would have yielded an interpretable slideThe number of deferred cases is a measure of the capacity of pathology personnel to produce high-quality slidesCorrective measure: Review appropriate preparation of frozen sections slides with pathology personnelSpecimens not amenable to frozen section or cytologic examination: It may not be possible to evaluate fatty tissue or heavily calcified specimens, such as boneDeferral is appropriate if tissue cannot be examinedThe number of deferred cases is a measure of the number of cases that are submitted for IOC that cannot be examinedCorrective measure: Surgeons can be informed about types of specimens that cannot be evaluated by IOCRemember that some specimens not amenable to cryostat sectioning can be interpreted using intraoperative cytology preparationsLack of sufficient clinical information for evaluation: In some cases, clinical information is essential to provide diagnosisCommon examplesBrain and bone lesion evaluation requires information about imaging findingsInformation about prior radiation or chemotherapy is necessary to determine if cells with atypia are more likely malignant or due to treatment-induced changesThyroid follicles associated with lymphocytes and germinal centers could be metastatic carcinoma to a lymph node or an area of nodular lymphocytic thyroiditis, depending on history of malignancy and location of noduleDeferral is appropriate if information cannot or is not provided by the surgeon or is unavailable in the system (e.g., electronic medical record)The number of deferred cases is a measure of cases without essential clinical informationCorrective measure: Surgeons are informed of information needed by the pathologist for IOCReview of hospital &/or laboratory information system for patients with scheduled operations likely to generate IOC can be helpfulCases Not Considered DeferredIn some situations, definitive diagnosis is not provided, but the case should not be considered deferred for QA purposesProvisional diagnosis: In many cases, it is appropriate to provide some diagnostic information on IOC, but the final diagnosis is best made after evaluation of permanent sections and possible ancillary studiesCommon examplesSpindle cell neoplasmLymphoproliferative disorderEncapsulated follicular neoplasm of thyroidLesional tissue presentThe goal of IOC is to provide optimum intraprocedural patient and specimen management; in this pursuit, a correct but less specific diagnosis is better than an incorrect but more specific diagnosis, i.e., \"diagnostic minimalism\" is appropriateThe number of such cases should not be used as a measure of quality of IOCCanceled diagnosis: In some cases, IOC may be requested that is considered inappropriate or unnecessary by the pathologistPathologist should discuss the case with the surgeon to come to a decision to cancel requestThis should be considered a canceled request and not a deferred diagnosisBENCHMARKSStudies of General AccuracyOverall accuracy generally in 90-98% range across specimen types in large studiesFalse-negatives are much more frequent (~ 7x) than false-positivesSampling error is more common than interpretive errorAccuracy is generally higher for more narrowly defined (e.g., margin assessment of known malignancy) than general (\"what is this mass\") questionsADASP BenchmarksRecommendations for maximum acceptable ratesDisagreement: Major cases = 3%Deferral: Inappropriate cases = 10%Variables Affecting Accuracy\nIncidence of target lesion in populationIf true positives are rare, even studies with low sensitivity may have high negative predictive valueReason for IOCDefined question, such as margin positivity of known cancer type, may yield accuracy approaching 100%Accuracy of primary diagnosis of unknown tumor type is closer to 80%Inclusion or exclusion of lesions is difficult to diagnose on frozen sectionNoninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear featuresPaget disease of vulvaSkin margins for melanomaPrimary diagnosis of Hirschsprung diseaseInclusion or exclusion of small lesions is difficult or impossible to reliably detect by frozen sectionMicropapillary carcinoma of thyroidMicrometastases or isolated tumor cells in sentinel nodes for breast cancerInclusion or exclusion of deferred casesDefinition of \"deferred\" diagnosis variesExclusion of these cases reduces total number of cases and, therefore, increases error rateSite-Specific AccuracyAccuracy is variable according to the types of cases includedFor specialty hospitals and centers of excellence, it may be appropriate to set specimen-specific benchmarks for reportingPositive/negative predictive value of IOC by specimen type often has more clinical utility than sensitivity/specificity/accuracy, e.g., SLN sampling in breast cancerSTRATEGIES TO PREVENT ERRORClinical InformationPreoperative conferences for complex cases heavily reliant on clinical or imaging information (e.g., orthopedic tumors) are very usefulEnsure surgeons are aware of information that can alter IOC interpretationUtilize medical records, when possible, to obtain essential information prior to IOCRequest additional information from the surgeon if the reason for IOC is unclear or if unusual findings are encounteredPatient IdentificationUse of 2 identifiers on specimen and slide labelsRead back of patient identification by operating room team [Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) requirement]Accession case with laboratory ID number as early as possible in handling processAll paperwork, slides, and specimen containers must be labeledSamplingCareful gross examination and sectioning of mass lesions are essentialAdditional sampling of gross specimen or block is appropriate when only limited lesion is present for evaluation on slideBeware of secondary processes, such as scar, abscess, and granulomataSampling from edge of malignancy may only reveal reactive changesExamples of site-specific strategies to improve samplingAdditional gross or microscopic sectioning of lung granulomas and scarsAdditional sampling of large ovarian/adnexal masses, particularly mucinous tumorsIf malignancy is not seen on initial sections, attending pathologist should reexamine gross specimenComplete exhaustion of negative tissue margins in skin excisionsSubmission by surgeon of en face margins distinct from resection specimen for complex anatomic specimens (e.g., pancreatic duct margin, head and neck mucosal excisions)If the diagnosis is not possible, request additional samples from the surgeon if feasible or defer the diagnosis if notInterpretationCases appropriate for IOC should be determined by institutionInappropriate requests can be harmful to patients and may be more prone to errore.g., small primary lesions should not be completely frozen for diagnosisPreview of scheduled cases, including review of any available prior slides for comparison, is helpfulUse cytology preparations as adjunct to conventional frozen sectionsUse of differential diagnosis lists; a diagnosis not considered cannot be madeHave relevant resources with information about IOC readily availableConsideration of metastatic disease, particularly in \"sump\" organs (lung, liver, brain)Pathologist should be aware of clinical consequence of diagnosisIn some cases, a false-negative diagnosis may cause less patient harm than a false-positive diagnosisCommunication about the degree of diagnosis certainty may be helpful to the surgeonFalse-negative diagnoses are more common than false-positive diagnosesPathologists tend to be conservativeSpecific criteria for malignancy can be helpful (e.g., for pancreatic carcinoma)Obtain 2nd opinion, when possible, on site or via telepathologyGeneral \"2nd eye\" or use of pathologist \"hospitalist\" who specializes in intraprocedural evaluationSubspecialist expertiseMay be ad hoc or institutional policy for certain case types, e.g., brain tumors, donor organs for transplantationTechnical FactorsMake sure cryostats are working at the beginning of the day by cutting the test slideEnsure all personnel using cryostats and stain lines are adequately trainedDo not hesitate to cut additional sections if tissue folds or holes make interpretation difficultCommunicationReporting diagnoses by telephone or intercom should follow recommended proceduresConfirm patient identityIdentify the pathologist rendering the diagnosisIdentify the operating room team member receiving the reportState the findings in the clearest terms possible;

            "raw_text": "INTRODUCTIONFactors Predisposing to InjuryThe risk to personnel in the intraoperative consultation (IOC) room is greater than the risk to pathology personnel in general due to multiple factorsTime constraintsActivities (e.g., examining specimens, cutting sections) need to be performed quicklyMultiple people from different departments use the IOC roomPathology personnel, surgeons, operating room nurses, and researchers may be presentNot all people may be familiar with best practices for the room and specimensMultiple people may be involved in examining a single specimenEach person must be responsible for appropriate and careful handling and disposal of sharpsUnfamiliarity with room &/or equipmentSome personnel may only use the room intermittentlySafety equipment may not always be used appropriatelyMaterials may not be replaced or replenished appropriatelyThe room may be used at night and on weekends when personnel familiar with the workspace are not presentLess experienced personnel may perform tasks at irregular intervalsMay only use cryostat during IOCsPatients undergoing surgery may have undiagnosed infectious diseaseExposure may occur due to penetrating trauma, inhalation, or mucocutaneous exposureMajority of specimens harboring infectious organisms do not pose risk to people who are not immunocompromisedPathology personnel who are immunocompromised or with compromised skin (dermatitis, weeping skin lesions, or wounds) may have increased vulnerabilityIt is important to have protocols and personnel in place to ensure safety1 person should be designated as being in charge of IOC roomEnsures the room is properly equipped and maintainedProvides training to new personnelSupervises daily use of the roomNew pathology personnel should be trained in appropriate procedures during IOCTraining should occur annually or when a new procedure is introducedTRAUMATIC INJURIESSourcesRazor bladesShould have a single blade and always be used with protective sheathCryostat bladesBlades should never be cleaned with handsA large swab (e.g., gauze wrapped around an applicator) is a safer method to brush shavings away from the bladeInjuries from cryostat blades are particularly problematic as exposure to multiple specimens is possibleIf a chuck or block needs to be manipulated, this should be done outside of cryostatRemoval of excess embedding materialRemoval of staples from tissueScalpelsBlades must be removed with caution using hemostat or forcepsA common source of injuries is during removal of the blade when it is contaminatedLarge cutting bladesDisposable blades are preferredCan be disposed rather than cleanedDo not require sharpeningSyringe needlesThe use of needles is rarely indicated and should be avoided due to the risk of penetrating injuriesIf used, the needle should be directly discarded into a sharps container and not recappedNeedles should not be used to mark the site of the lesion for later evaluationLarge paperclips can be threaded through tissue to mark lesions (e.g., the site where a radioactive seed was removed)If multiple lesions are present, paperclips of different colors can be usedTypes of InjuriesThe most common type of injury is a laceration from a bladeNondominant hand injuries are most common but also occur to the dominant handInjuries can potentially convey infectious agentsHepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, and TBThere are 2 cases of tumors being transferred to a healthcare worker via accidental injury1 due to scalpel injury during surgery and 1 due to needle stick in research laboratoryPreventionAll blades must be discarded by the person using the bladeA common source of injury is from blades hidden by surgical drapes, paper towels, or tissueBlades should be discarded rather than left on the workspace surface after useThe hand holding the specimen should be well away from the hand holding the bladeHard specimens that require increased force to section are particularly hazardousThe specimen can be held with gauze, which provides a firmer grip and helps keep the nondominant hand away from the bladeKevlar gloves or metal mesh gloves are availableIn actual practice, these gloves are unwieldy and difficult to useUse of needles and other piercing instruments should be avoidedFrozen embedding medium should not be removed from the chuck using a bladeCommon source of injuryThe chuck can be kept at room temperature until the block is melted or the chuck and block can be briefly dipped into a formalin container to speed meltingCytologic preparations should be used rather than frozen sections when infection is suspectedWhen possible, it is helpful to use a single dedicated cryostat for infectious casesINHALATIONSourcesTissue from patients with infectious diseaseCoworkers can also pose a hazard during a pandemic with a respiratory virus, such as COVID-19Masks should be worn according to institutional practicesChemicals (stains, fixatives)Formaldehyde and xylene are of most concernAfter initial levels are shown to be low, subsequent monitoring of room is not required unless there is concern for exposureMechanism of InjuryInfectionOnly reported when aerosolized coolants have been used to freeze blocks with tissue containing Mycobacterium tuberculosisCoolants should not be sprayed directly onto tissueIf used to cool a block, resulting aerosol should be contained within cryostat and not inhaledBetter alternative methods for cooling blocks rapidly are availableSpecimens are unlikely to pose a threat under other conditionsChemical inhalationUnlikely to occur unless chemicals are not stored properly or unless there is a large spillPreventionInfectionMasks designed to protect from aerosolized bacteria are availableSpecific masks for protection from M. tuberculosis should be used when specimens from patients with known infections are examinedChemical inhalationAppropriate ventilation of IOC room is essentialChemicals must be tightly capped and storedStaining racks should be kept covered when not in use to prevent evaporation as well as air contaminationSpill kit and protocol must be availableMUCOCUTANEOUS EXPOSURESourcesBloody specimensCysts with fluid under pressureTypes of InjuriesSplash injury into eyes or mouthCutaneous exposure into breaks in skinPreventionPersonal protective equipment (PPE) must always be wornProtective goggles or face masks must be worn when handling specimens that are likely to pose a risk of splashingDouble gloves should be worn when handling particularly bloody specimens or specimens of known or suspected infectious riskExtreme care should be exercised when cutting into a hard, intact mass that could be cysticPiercing cyst can result in forceful ejection of fluid for several feetA waterproof barrier may be kept over the site of incision until it is determined if fluid is present or notCysts should be opened near a sink to aid in the disposal of fluid cyst contentsEating, drinking, smoking, and application of cosmetics or lip balm are not allowed in the IOC roomFood cannot be stored in the room or refrigerators and must not be discarded in waste containersMaterial that will leave the IOC room must be clean to protect personnel outside the room from exposuresOuter specimen container is kept cleanAll paperwork is kept cleanIf contamination occurs, paperwork can be placed inside protective plastic sleeve or information copied onto clean formINFECTIOUS AGENTSGeneral GuidelinesFreezing does not inactivate infectious agentsFormalin inactivates many infectious agents but may require many hours to do soPrions remain infective after routine fixationIOCs should only be performed when absolutely necessary on specimens suspected to harbor an infectious agentHowever, the majority of infectious agents do not pose risks to immunocompetent individualsOnly 3 reported cases of transmission of infectious agent during IOC (all M. tuberculosis)Tuberculosis3 cases of conversion to positive skin tests have been reported during performance of frozen sectionAll involved use of aerosolized coolant and inhalationAerosols should be avoidedYearly TB tests are recommended for all hospital personnelCreutzfeldt-Jakob Disease3 technicians working in laboratories studying Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) have died of this disease1 technician had a known penetrating injury from a forceps after handling frozen tissueThe other 2 technicians did not have a specific injury documentedNo cases have been reported during performance of IOCSpecial techniques are necessary to inactivate prion proteinsFormalin fixation for 24 hours95% formic acid for 1 hourFormalin fixation for another 24 hoursSymptoms suggestive of CJD includeRapidly progressive dementiaMyoclonusNonspecific neurologic findingsTissue handlingSpecimens from patients with suspected CJD should not be examined by IOCTissue should be fixed immediately following recommended protocols and stored in a secure locationThe clinical necessity of tissue processing should be considered carefully before placing personnel at riskHIVNo cases have been reported during performance of IOC1 reported case of a pathologist infected after scalpel injury to hand during performance of autopsy~ 0.3% risk of infection after penetrating injuryPostexposure prophylaxis includes 4-week treatment with 2 drugsHepatitis B VirusNo cases have been reported during performance of IOC~ 30% risk of infection after percutaneous penetrating injuryLikely also high risk after mucocutaneous exposureInfectious hepatitis B virus (HBV) can exist in dried blood for at least 1 weekPathology personnel should be vaccinated for hepatitis BIf nonvaccinated person is exposed, postexposure prophylaxis includes vaccination for HBVHepatitis B immune globulin can also be usedHepatitis C VirusNo cases have been reported during performance of IOC~ 0.2% risk of exposure after penetrating injuryRisk after mucocutaneous exposure is likely lowDegrades rapidly in environmentPersonnel should be monitored for infection after exposurePostexposure prophylaxis has not been shown to be effectiveTUMORSRisk After ExposureThere are 2 reports of tumors being transferred to another individual after accidental exposureA sarcoma was transferred via a hand injury to a surgeonGenetic analysis showed that tumor was derived from patientThe tumor was excised, and the physician remained well 2 years laterA colonic adenocarcinoma cell line was transferred to a laboratory worker via a needle injuryThe carcinoma was excised, and the worker remained well 4 years laterProcedures to avoid exposure to infectious agents also prevent exposure to tumorsRisk of transferring tumor to another person is extremely lowRADIATIONSpecimensRadioactive agents are sometimes used intraoperativelySentinel lymph node identificationRadioactive seeds for localization of breast lesionsOctreotide to localize neuroendocrine lesionsThe dose used is generally too low to result in significant exposure to pathology personnelSpecial procedures are generally not required to limit exposureStandard gloves are adequate for protectionRadioactive seeds contain I-125 that emits low-energy gamma rays of 20-30 keVTitanium capsule surrounds internal core filament containing I-125If internal core filament is damaged, the area must be treated as a radioactive spillDamaging the seed should be avoided by not using scissors and very carefully sectioning the specimen with a scalpel under guidance with gamma probeNo injuries have been reportedAdequate storage area is required for retrieved radioactive materialRadioactive seeds can be safely stored in a metal containerThe seed must be stored in a closed container listing the corresponding surgical pathology numberLog book is required to document the specific seed, when it is retrieved from the specimen, and when it is released to the Radiation Safety DepartmentPreventionIf radioactive agents are used during surgery, risk to pathology personnel should be consideredIf radioactive materials need to be retrieved (e.g., radioactive seeds), procedures for doing so must be institutedPathologists must have necessary equipment (e.g., Geiger counter, gamma probe) to monitor radioactive material and to detect radioactive medical devicesPERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENTGeneral GuidelinesPPE is defined as equipment designed to prevent exposure of skin or clothing to blood or other infectious materialsWorn to minimize exposure to hazards that cause serious workplace injuries and illnessesIncludes chemical, radiologic, physical, electrical, mechanical, or other workplace hazardsMust be provided by institution to employeesMust be discarded appropriately when contaminated and when leaving the IOC roomHandsGloves must always be worn when handling tissuesRings with sharp surfaces should be removed as they can increase the likelihood of puncture2 pairs of gloves are recommended if infectious agent is suspectedLatex gloves protect against biohazards but not chemicalsLatex is permeable to chemicals and can rapidly degrade when exposed to some typesNitrile and neoprene gloves protect against biohazards and exposure to fixativesPersonnel with latex allergy may use nitrile glovesMetal mesh and Kevlar cloth gloves are available if puncture injuries are possibleLatex or nitrile gloves are worn beneath and over glovesSoiled gloves should be discarded and replaced when touching other objects in roomGloves should also be changed between specimens to avoid any chance of contamination\"Clean\" areas should be established in which gloves are not wornHands must always be washed after handling specimens and when leaving IOC roomSmall, inapparent breaks in gloves are commonIf 2 gloves are worn and blood is present between gloves, gloves should immediately be removed to determine the source of bloodIf a hand injury is identified, first aid and evaluation of infection exposure is requiredGloves should not be worn when touching items used by people who do not wear glovesTelephones, computers, pagers, microscopes, paperwork, other areas designated as \"clean\" areasThese items should be kept clean and only handled with clean, bare handsHead and FaceEye protection should be worn if splash injuries are possibleSafety glasses or gogglesFull face maskFace protection should include side shieldsSpecial respiratory masks protect against aerosolized TBN-95 masks filter at least 95% of particulates that are 3 μm or largerRequires each person to be individually fitted for maskIn practice, these masks are uncomfortable and not often usedSurgical masksDesigned to protect patients from exhalations of person wearing maskInadequate to protect pathology personnel from aerosolized infectious agentsCan provide protection of mouth and lower face from splashesSurgical capsGenerally not requiredBodyScrub suits may be worn when exposure is probableThese clothes can be easily exchanged for clean replacements if exposure occursAprons are used over clothes or scrub suits to protect torsoSleeve protectors or aprons with sleeves are preferable when numerous specimens are handledDisposable jumpsuits offer complete coverage of bodyLab coats should not be used for protection if also worn outside of the IOC roomShoe covers are generally not necessaryEQUIPMENT AND ROOMCryostatIdeally, 1 cryostat should be designated for known or possible infectious casesCases requiring decontamination include known or suspected HIV, HBV, HCV, respiratory viruses, prion disease, mycobacterial disease, or systemic fungal diseaseAfter cryostat is used for such cases, it must be marked and not used again until after decontaminationAll cryostats must be decontaminated at defined intervalsCryostat is defrostedTuberculocidal disinfectant is used to clean interiorTrimmings and sections of tissues must be removedCollege of American Pathologists (CAP) laboratory accreditation program requires documented procedure for decontamination at defined intervalsMore frequent decontamination is necessary if known infectious cases have been processedRoom\"Clean\" areas should be designated where gloves must not be wornTypically microscopes, telephones, door knobsMost common items used by personnel are not directly involved in processing specimensOnly clean hands without gloves are allowed to handle material in these areasAvoids possible contamination with biohazardous material that has touched

interpretation is part of a formal diagnostic report or the patient record\"In general, traditional glass slides are viewed remotelyIn newer systems, ex vivo digital images can be evaluated using telepathologyAdvantages of Telepathology for Intraoperative ConsultationInterpretation can be provided from multiple locationsPathologists can be far from the intraoperative consultation (IOC) roomEasier availability outside working hoursGreater access to underserved or remote locationsEasier access to multiple opinions or subspecialty expertiseSome cases are very difficult and benefit from multiple reviewersUnusual tumors or tumors post neoadjuvant therapySubtle judgments of invasion or margin status, particularly in cases in which there is extensive cautery or crush artifactPathology practice is increasingly subspecializedMaintaining subspecialist availability 24 hours/day, 7 days/week for IOC is logistical challenge for all pathology groups, including large academic departmentsIn some healthcare systems, hospitals with specialized clinical centers of excellence may require more intense subspecialty pathology support than can be provided on siteEfficiency in staffingMismatch of case volume and need for on-site presence can be alleviated through case flow, not limited by proximity to slide productionIn large networks or multihospital systems, telepathology (for both IOC and permanent section consultation) allows for more efficient use of pathologist resourcesCreates opportunities for smaller pathology groups to work cooperatively for IOC or expertise sharingAccess to prior pathologyIn institutions with digital archives, images of patients' prior pathology specimens may be accessible for real-time comparison to frozen section findingsReview of prior tumor histology can be critical for interpretation of intraoperative findings, especially after neoadjuvant treatmentAvailability of images to IOC team not limited by time needed to retrieve archived glass slidesEasy archiving of digital imagesImages readily accessibleQuality assurance studiesConferences and teachingMedicolegal purposesFocal findings on a specific intraoperatively prepared slide can be annotated and savedEasier correlation with final permanent section evaluationAnnotation of image does not permanently obscure finding on glass slideComputer-aided interpretationImage analysis to assist in interpretation of slides may become an option in futureComputer [artificial intelligence (AI)]-assisted diagnosisAI screening for focal findings, such as small metastasesMore reliable quantification of findings is important for assessment and IOC decision makinge.g., counting neutrophils in cases of suspected joint infectionRegulatory IssuesCollege of American Pathologists Accreditation Requirements for TelepathologyCAP Laboratory Accreditation ChecklistAs of 2022, the section on Telepathology and Remote Data assessment is contained in the \"Laboratory General\" section; testing within the laboratory using the laboratory's validated software is specifically excluded from this checklist sectionTelepathology modes definedStatic telepathology: Preselected still image(s)Dynamic telepathology: Real-time viewing of images (includes robotic microscopy, video streaming, and desktop sharing)Virtual slides/whole-slide imaging (WSI): Digitization of entire slideChecklist section applies toPrimary diagnoses made by telepathologyFrozen section diagnosesFormal 2nd-opinion consultationsAncillary techniques in which the pathologist participates in interpretation of imagesReal-time evaluation of fine-needle aspiration specimens for triaging and preliminary diagnosesChecklist items as of 2022GEN.50057: There is a method for the individual reviewing cases to ensure correct patient identification for slides/images and data files submitted for reviewGEN.50614: The individual reviewing cases has access to pertinent clinical information at the time of slide/image(s) or remote data file reviewGEN.50630: The laboratory validates telepathology systems used for clinical diagnostic purposes by performing its own validation studies, including approval for use by the laboratory director (or designee who meets CAP director qualifications) before the technology is used for the intended diagnostic purpose(s)GEN.51728: The lab has a procedure addressing training requirements for all users of the telepathology systemGEN.52842: There are procedures in place to ensure that sites engaging in telepathology and remote data assessment provide reasonable confidentiality and securityGEN.52850: The telepathology records include diagnoses made and statements of adequacy assessment, preliminary diagnosis, or recommendations for additional studies provided at the time of evaluationGEN.52860: The telepathology services are included in the laboratory's quality management programGEN.52900: There are records showing that all users of the WSI system have been trainedGEN.52920: The laboratory validates WSI systems used for clinical diagnostic purposes by performing its own validation studies, including approval for use by the laboratory director (or designee who meets CAP director qualifications) before the technology is used for the intended diagnostic purpose(s)The checklist is not applicable toInformal reviews without formal reportingEducational or research useGovernmental Regulations for TelepathologyWSI has been approved as an FDA class II diagnostic device in the United States for primary pathology diagnosisIn the last 5 years, several systems have received approval for marketingThis has also improved the general climate for labs and systems to expand the use of WSI for primary diagnosis as a laboratory developed test (LDT)WSI has been approved and is employed in Canada for primary pathology diagnosisIOC diagnosis in most cases can be reasonably regarded as preliminary in nature, subject to subsequent review in the context of permanent and additional sections and, therefore, not a final primary diagnosisExceptions to this characterization would include specimens completely exhausted by protocol for IOC diagnosis &/or not retained for permanent section (e.g., Mohs surgery)Consensus guidelines for validation of WSI have been published and includeAll laboratories using WSI clinically should implement their own validation studiesValidation can encompass the entire WSI system (i.e., each component need not be separately validated)A qualified pathologist should be involvedValidation should be appropriate to intended clinical useValidation slides for IOC should employ intraoperatively prepared frozen sections or cytology preparationsStudy should establish glass slide/digital image intraobserver variabilityValidation should emulate real-world environmentWash-out periods between review of glass slide and digital image mandatedValidation should confirm that all material present on the glass slide is included in the digital image60 cases has been suggested as a requirement for a single application, which should reflect spectrum and complexity of case typesLicensurePathologists may make diagnoses on specimens from different institutions, different states, or different countriesLicensure requirements vary by jurisdictionRequirements in both receiving and sending jurisdictions must be followedIt is typical for pathologists performing telepathology consultations to be licensed in multiple statesReimbursementAt this time, diagnoses by telepathology are billable in the same manner as direct on-site evaluationCategories of Telepathology MethodsStaticStill digital images are taken from preselected areasThe digital camera may beA fixed part of a microscopeA camera, phone, or other camera-containing device attached to an eyepiecePhotographs are transmitted to a consultant, usually as JPEG attachmentsEmailText messageLess commonly as image cache accessed from remote computerAdvantagesInexpensive and fastRecipient does not need special equipment or computer to review images1st-line pathologist can select and carefully capture areas of concernVery focal findingsCytology findings, particularly if focal or if smear is suboptimalNo requirement for real-time interaction with the person in the IOC roomUseful for cases in which rapid diagnosis is needed for expedited postoperative, but not necessarily intraoperative, managementImages can be kept as a permanent file and attached to a case in some laboratory information systemsDisadvantagesQuality of images for review is heavily influenced by expertise and bias of 1st-line pathologistSubspecialty expertise may be needed for both selection and interpretation of key areasExcept for very small pieces of tissue, ability of consultant to evaluate the entire specimen is limitedAbsolutely dependent on prosector; subject to sampling errorOnly portions of tissue are captured on the slide and only at set magnificationsDynamic/RoboticTransmission of a video stream from a microscope to a receiving pathologistThe slide is viewed on a microscope with a digital or analog video cameraVideo images are transferred to a remote site by closed network or web-based sharing systemsMicroscope stage movement and focus may be controlled byOn-site personnel under verbal direction of a remote pathologistA pathologist on-site, directing a remote consultant's attention to selected areasOff-site pathologist via robotic microscopyWeb-based sharing systemsRequire computer at on-site video captureCan use computer, phone, or handheld device (for commercially available systems with device applications)AdvantagesAll information available on a slide is potentially available to an off-site pathologistIf a robotic microscope controlled by an off-site pathologist is used, this closely mimics a pathologist being on-siteViewing of images takes place in real time with communication between a person on-site and a pathologistDisadvantagesIf the on-site person controls the microscope, quality is heavily dependent on sender expertiseCan be time consuming for off-site pathologistAvailable products vary significantly in user experienceImages are not routinely savedWhole-Slide ImagesLarge images composed of many smaller static images stitched togetherAfter preparation, the entire slide is scanned, uploaded, and stored as a digitized image on institution- or cloud-based serverA digitized image can be viewed on a computer by an off-site pathologistAdvantagesDoes not require expertise to choose the most diagnostic areas of a slideProvides closest experience to (and sometimes better than) on-site viewing of glass slidesSpecialized software allows viewing of slide at different magnificationsImage can be kept permanently, viewed at any time, and annotated for permanent section correlationDisadvantagesTime to scan a slide is dependent on the size of the tissue area and magnificationScanning at 40x very slow (but usually not necessary)Slide preparation is extremely importantClean, glue freePlacement of tissue centrally on glassMinimal folds or other artifacts that vary thickness of tissuePersonnel must be well trained in using the instrumentNot suitable for multiple users with minimal training &/or episodic experienceCytology slides should be uniformly thin and may require 40x scanningScanners are expensiveStored file sizes for WSI are extremely large1 image at a single focal depth does not capture information from the entire thickness of tissue on a slideMay be important when evaluating very small structures, such as mitotic figuresAdvanced systems image a slide at multiple focal depths (Z axis)However, this greatly increases scanning time and file size for each slideTissue marking dyes for margins often appear darker and can be misinterpretedIdeally, a frozen section would only include a single margin for evaluationEx Vivo MicroscopyImages are obtained from fresh tissue using reflected light of various wavelengthsThe digital images are viewed on an on-site screen or via telepathologyAdvantagesMinimal or no tissue preparation is neededImage acquisition is rapid (< 3 minutes)Freezing artifact is avoidedDisadvantagesRequires expensive specialized equipmentCurrently in research and development stage for most systemsArtifacts specific to these techniques may be introducedOnly the surface of the tissue is imagedHybrid MethodsEmploy combinations of dynamic or robotic methods with WSI or ex vivo microscopyIntegration of Telepathology Into Intraoperative ConsultationGross ExaminationQualified personnel on-site are critical to successful and safe provision of servicesResidents, pathology assistants, or specialized technologistsAct as qualified prosectors, following established protocolsMay be 1st responder on call, especially if attending pathologist lives in remote locationMay be used in hospitals without regular attending pathologist samplingDynamic streaming may be needed for direction of large specimen samplingIn an ideal system, images of large gross specimens are captured as digital photographs with annotation for frozen section sampling sitesPreparation of SlidesPersonnel on-site prepare cytologic or frozen section slidesMicroscopic ExaminationImage capture remains \"add-on\" to workflow for on-site personnelStatic image telepathology: Images are taken by cameraUsually requires at least pathology residency training to select diagnostic areasRobotic telepathology: Slide is placed on microscope stageWSI: Slides must be placed in scannerAttending pathologistIf the pathologist is on-site, slides can be viewed directly via microscope, or images can be viewed on screenIf the pathologist is off-site, slides &/or images can be viewed according to system utilizedIn either situation, the pathologist can use telepathology for subspecialist or 2nd opinion on unusual or challenging casesQuality AssuranceThe IOC quality assurance program should specifically address telepathology accuracy and qualityMultiple studies are available in the literature documenting the comparable reliability of image-performed IOCs to those performed on glass slides and can be used for benchmarking",

        "raw_text": "SURGICAL/CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONSGoal of ConsultationTo determine if a bone lesion is benign/reactive or malignantTo evaluate margins after a definitive resection of a malignant bone tumorChange in Patient ManagementReactive lesions may be followed clinically or excisedBenign neoplasms are often excised or curetted without the need to document negative marginsLow-grade malignancies are resected, often widely (if possible) and with margin assessmentComplete curettage may also be attempted in some well-localized tumorsHigh-grade malignancies may be treated with radiation/chemotherapy prior to resection or resected before treatmentPositive bony &/or marrow margins may generate additional resection or possibly closure and subsequent adjuvant therapyImaging with MR can accurately predict the extent of tumorIf adequate surgical margins are planned based on the imaging appearance, the likelihood of a positive pathologic margin is lowClinical SettingPatient age ranges from pediatric to adultLytic &/or blastic lesions are identified by radiographyMay be incidentally discovered on plain film during evaluation for other conditionsBone destruction &/or soft tissue invasion are often apparent in locally aggressive &/or malignant tumorsMalignancies are more likely than benign lesions to cause painSPECIMEN EVALUATIONRadiographReview of appropriate patient radiographs or radiologic reports prior to receipt of a specimen is highly recommendedThe radiologist's differential diagnosis is essential for correlation with pathologic findingsOften identifies whether or not the lesion is growing aggressivelyKnowing the specific bone and the anatomic region of bone involved is diagnostically useful informationThe identification of an aggressive growth pattern radiographically can be essential in classifying low-grade bone malignancies intraoperativelyGrossDiagnostic bone specimens are almost invariably composed of small fragments of soft tissue and boneMargins sent for bone tumors are either peripheral soft tissue margins or intramedullary marrow marginsFrozen SectionSeparate hard bony fragments from soft tissue fragmentsSofter bony fragments can be frozen, but harder bone may damage the cryostat blade &/or distort a frozen sectionTissue that can be cut easily with a scalpel blade can generally be sectioned on a cryostatAll tissue should be frozen unless the entire lesion has been curetted and sent to pathologyIf completely curetted, representative tissue from specimen usually sufficesThese specimens are usually from presumptively benign lesionsCytologyA marrow curettage sample may be provided to evaluate bone marginsThe sample is spread on a glass slide as a cytology specimenTouch prep slides of lesional tissue may be helpful if metastatic carcinoma is suspectedMOST COMMON DIAGNOSESMetastasisFar more common than primary bone tumorsCarcinoma is most common, but melanoma, sarcoma, or lymphoma may also spread to boneMust always be considered in patients > 45 years oldPatients often have a history of cancer elsewhere as well as prior metastatic disease (e.g., to lymph nodes, lung)Any bone may be involvedMost often proximal humerus, proximal femur, or spineHistologic appearance depends on primary tumorUsually adenocarcinoma (most common primary sites include breast, lung, kidney, prostate, liver, and thyroid)Some metastatic carcinomas (particularly from prostate) are osteoblastic and produce focal to abundant woven boneAmount of tumor present may be relatively limited compared to the size of the lytic lesionMetastases can stimulate osteoclasts to resorb boneMultiple sections may need to be examined to identify metastatic cellsImmunohistochemical studies performed on permanent sections may be necessary for classification if no primary site is knownDecalcification can diminish immunoreactivity for some antigensIf possible, softer areas of tumor should be separated and not decalcifiedOsteosarcomaMost commonly presents as severe pain in young patients 10-20 years old2nd peak occurs in patients > 50 years old who have a predisposing condition (e.g., radiation, Paget disease)Most common malignant bone tumor (20%)Imaging often shows a large permeative and destructive lesion in metaphysis/diaphysis of long bone, most commonly around the region of the knee (~ 50% of cases)Most cases show sheets of frankly malignant cells with high level of mitotic activityDiagnosis depends on identification of pink seams of osteoid or immature bone directly produced by malignant cellsSome tumors may show focal or prominent cartilaginous differentiation, leading to possible confusion with chondrosarcomaYounger age and presence of cellular sheets of malignant cells (± osteoid) favor osteosarcomaOther variant morphologies include fibroblastic (spindled), small cell, clear cell, telangiectatic, and giant cell richEnchondromaOften painless unless associated with fractureImaging often shows a small, well-circumscribed lesion without locally aggressive features in diaphysis/metaphysis of long bonesIn long bones: Generally composed of fragments and nodules of bland hyaline cartilage, often with thin, pink seam of peripheral boneChondrocyte cellularity is often low and with minimal or no nuclear atypiaIn small bones of hands and feet: Often much more cellular and may demonstrate mild nuclear atypia and myxoid matrix degenerationClinical and radiologic correlation to evaluate for pathologic cortical bone disruption and soft tissue extension is most helpful in excluding chondrosarcomaIn some cases, it can be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to histologically distinguish enchondroma from low-grade chondrosarcomaCorrelation with imaging is often critical in making this distinctionIn ambiguous cases, a diagnosis of \"low-grade cartilaginous lesion, final diagnosis deferred to permanent sections\" is appropriateAny subsequent curetted tissue should be submitted for permanent histologic evaluationChondrosarcomaOften painfulThe majority of patients are > 50 years oldImaging generally shows irregular, large, and destructive tumor, often with cortical disruption and soft tissue extension, involving metaphysis/diaphysis of long bonesClear cell chondrosarcoma (variant) characteristically arises in epiphysis of long bonesCellularity and chondrocyte nuclear atypia vary widely, depending on grade, but most cases show a higher degree of both than is seen in benign cartilage or enchondromaChondrocyte necrosis and prominent matrix degeneration are also more common in chondrosarcomaIn some cases, a definitive diagnosis of a low-grade lesion will not be possible on frozen sectionChondrosarcoma of small bones of the hands and feet is very rare and requires evidence of true bony or soft tissue invasion for diagnosisDedifferentiated chondrosarcoma may show cellular, noncartilaginous high-grade sarcoma or

locally aggressive and may show limited soft tissue extensionComposed of sheets of multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells in background of bland, monomorphic ovoid, or spindled stromal cellsGiant cells may be very large (> 50 nuclei)Stromal cells should not show malignant cytologic features or atypical mitosesEvidence of frank malignancy should raise possibility of other tumors, such as metastatic carcinoma, osteosarcoma, dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma, etc.May contain areas of aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC)Epiphyseal location suggests secondary ABC over primary ABCChondroblastomaTypically occurs in skeletally immature patients with open growth plates (age range: 10-25 years old)Localization to epiphysis or apophysis of long bone is characteristicImaging shows a well-defined tumor of variable size, often with sclerotic marginsContains large number of osteoclast-like giant cells, similar to giant cell tumorPredominant cell type (chondroblast) is generally pink, epithelioid, and with a nucleus that is sometimes groovedIdentification of stromal chicken-wire calcification and fragments of cartilage is commonChondroblastoma can be distinguished from giant cell tumorYoung age, epithelioid \"fried-egg\" cells with grooved nuclei, chicken-wire calcification, and presence of cartilage all favor chondroblastomaMay contain areas of ABCFibrous DysplasiaMost common in young to middle-aged patients; often asymptomaticMay present as solitary or multiple lesions (either within same or different bones)Most common in long bonesOther sites (e.g., ribs and craniofacial bones) may be involvedImaging shows well-circumscribed intramedullary tumor, most commonly in diaphysis and metadiaphysisComposed of mixture of fibroblasts and immature (woven) bone trabeculaeSpindled fibroblasts are bland and may demonstrate storiform growth patternStroma is often collagenous but may be myxoidWoven bone trabeculae are characteristically irregularly shaped, discontinuous, and often lack osteoblastic rimmingWoven bone production can be focal in some tumors and may not be sampled, potentially leading to diagnostic difficultyDoes not demonstrate infiltrative or permeative growth pattern through preexisting lamellar bone (this finding suggests low-grade osteosarcoma)Aneurysmal Bone CystMost commonly arises in young patients (< 20 years old) in metaphyseal region of long bonesImaging generally shows expansile, lytic, and cystic lesion, often with fluid levels due to bloodComposed of variably thick cyst walls containing bland, spindled to ovoid cells, scattered giant cells, and focal seams of osteoidFrankly malignant cells are inconsistent with diagnosis and may suggest telangiectatic osteosarcomaEpiphyseal lesions with the appearance of an ABC are usually different tumors (giant cell tumor, chondroblastoma, etc.) with a secondary ABCOsteomyelitisPatients often complain of pain and systemic symptomsCan easily mimic neoplasm on imagingEarly osteomyelitis shows fragments of mature lamellar bone associated with granulation tissue, necrotic bone, and collections of acute inflammatory cellsChronic osteomyelitis often shows intertrabecular loose fibrosis and more prominent plasma cell infiltrateFibrous dysplasia and low-grade osteosarcoma show cellular spindle cell proliferation rather than loose fibrosisPlasma cell neoplasms contain sheets of plasma cells and lack granulation tissueLangerhans Cell Histiocytosis (Eosinophilic Granuloma)Usually presents in first 3 decades of lifeMay be solitary (eosinophilic granuloma) or multifocalSystemic disease involves multiple organ systems and frequently occurs in first 2 years of lifeMost common in craniofacial bones but can involve any boneImaging usually shows small, well-defined lesion (may have punched-out appearance)Composed of irregular sheets and nests of pink histiocytic cells (Langerhans cells) within typically prominent mixed chronic inflammatory

storiform growth pattern associated with scattered multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cellsNumber of giant cells may be striking, but sheets of giant cells are not seen (as in giant cell

differentiationVery common primary malignant bone tumorsMost patients are middle aged or olderMay present as localized lesion (plasmacytoma) or as component of widespread disease (plasma cell myeloma)Composed of sheets of plasma cells demonstrating varying degrees of nuclear atypiaPoorly differentiated plasma cells may be difficult to distinguish from carcinoma, and clinical/radiographic correlation or even deferral may be requiredTouch preps may be helpful in evaluation of cellsLymphomaMost commonly represents involvement of bone by systemic disease, although primary lymphomas of bone rarely occurUsually occurs in adults, but age range is wideImaging shows large, destructive mass often centered in metadiaphysis of long boneMay extend to form soft tissue massHistologic appearance depends on type of lymphoma, but most form dyscohesive sheets of variably monomorphic round cells and would be classified as small round blue cell tumorsWell-formed cohesive nests and aggregates are not generally seen as in carcinomaEvaluation may be hindered by extensive crush artifact or necrosis, and more tissue should be requested for evaluation in this situationDiagnosis of

cellsLocation, age, and radiographic appearance are paramount for making diagnosisGiant cell tumor is reasonably considered in setting of epiphyseal bone lesion demonstrating sheets of multinucleated giant cells with no malignant stromal cell atypiaLow-Grade Chondrosarcoma vs. EnchondromaCan be extremely difficult if not impossible to distinguish histologicallyClinical behavior and radiographs are critical in helping make distinctionCortical erosion/destruction &/or soft tissue extension support chondrosarcomaEnchondroma is typically small, well localized, and more likely to be found incidentallyDiagnosis of \"low-grade cartilaginous neoplasm, final diagnosis deferred to permanent sections\" is acceptable in cases with little to no supportive clinicoradiologic informationMisinterpreting Fracture Callus as MalignancyIdentification of fracture in patients > 45 years old should prompt careful search for metastatic carcinomaPathologic fracture can coexist in benign or malignant lesionsFracture is often known or suspected clinicallyPreexisting history of trauma to area is often availableFracture callus is composed of hypercellular cartilage admixed with woven bone formation and fibroconnective tissue, often in relatively linear array (along original fracture line)Hypercellular cartilage may raise possibility of chondrosarcoma, but overall context essentially precludes that diagnosisExuberant fracture callus may clinically simulate (rare) true bone neoplasm due to apparent bony expansionSmall Focus of Metastatic Carcinoma Not SeenA high level of suspicion for metastatic carcinoma must be maintained in any patient > 45 years oldThis is particularly important for patients with a history of carcinomaOften, a component of reactive stromal myofibroblastic proliferation is associated with metastasisIts sole presence may indicate that additional sections should be cut in case diagnostic tissue is focalAll remaining tissue should be submitted for frozen section evaluation if metastatic disease is suspected and initial evaluation is negativeMetastatic carcinomas can produce osteolytic factorsRadiologic lesion can be considerably larger than actual carcinomaBiopsy Not Representative of LesionNot uncommonReactive soft tissue overlying bone may be unintentionally sampled instead of true lesionWhat appears to be chronic osteomyelitis may actually be adjacent reactive and inflamed fibroblastic tissue overlying true neoplasmClinical and imaging findings help guide interpretation",

          "SPECIMEN EVALUATION": "RadiographReview of appropriate patient radiographs or radiologic reports prior to receipt of a specimen is highly recommendedThe radiologist's differential diagnosis is essential for correlation with pathologic findingsOften identifies whether or not the lesion is growing aggressivelyKnowing the specific bone and the anatomic region of bone involved is diagnostically useful informationThe identification of an aggressive growth pattern radiographically can be essential in classifying low-grade bone malignancies intraoperativelyGrossDiagnostic bone specimens are almost invariably composed of small fragments of soft tissue and boneMargins sent for bone tumors are either peripheral soft tissue margins or intramedullary marrow marginsFrozen SectionSeparate hard bony fragments from soft tissue fragmentsSofter bony fragments can be frozen, but harder bone may damage the cryostat blade &/or distort a frozen sectionTissue that can be cut easily with a scalpel blade can generally be sectioned on a cryostatAll tissue should be frozen unless the entire lesion has been curetted and sent to pathologyIf completely curetted, representative tissue from specimen usually sufficesThese specimens are usually from presumptively benign lesionsCytologyA marrow curettage sample may be provided to evaluate bone marginsThe sample is spread on a glass slide as a cytology specimenTouch prep slides of lesional tissue may be helpful if metastatic carcinoma is suspected",
          "MOST COMMON DIAGNOSES": "MetastasisFar more common than primary bone tumorsCarcinoma is most common, but melanoma, sarcoma, or lymphoma may also spread to boneMust always be considered in patients > 45 years oldPatients often have a history of cancer elsewhere as well as prior metastatic disease (e.g., to lymph nodes, lung)Any bone may be involvedMost often proximal humerus, proximal femur, or spineHistologic appearance depends on primary tumorUsually adenocarcinoma (most common primary sites include breast, lung, kidney, prostate, liver, and thyroid)Some metastatic carcinomas (particularly from prostate) are osteoblastic and produce focal to abundant woven boneAmount of tumor present may be relatively limited compared to the size of the lytic lesionMetastases can stimulate osteoclasts to resorb boneMultiple sections may need to be examined to identify metastatic cellsImmunohistochemical studies performed on permanent sections may be necessary for classification if no primary site is knownDecalcification can diminish immunoreactivity for some antigensIf possible, softer areas of tumor should be separated and not decalcifiedOsteosarcomaMost commonly presents as severe pain in young patients 10-20 years old2nd peak occurs in patients > 50 years old who have a predisposing condition (e.g., radiation, Paget disease)Most common malignant bone tumor (20%)Imaging often shows a large permeative and destructive lesion in metaphysis/diaphysis of long bone, most commonly around the region of the knee (~ 50% of cases)Most cases show sheets of frankly malignant cells with high level of mitotic activity\nDiagnosis depends on identification of pink seams of osteoid or immature bone directly produced by malignant cellsSome tumors may show focal or prominent cartilaginous differentiation, leading to possible confusion with chondrosarcomaYounger age and presence of cellular sheets of malignant cells (± osteoid) favor osteosarcomaOther variant morphologies include fibroblastic (spindled), small cell, clear cell, telangiectatic, and giant cell richEnchondromaOften painless unless associated with fractureImaging often shows a small, well-circumscribed lesion without locally aggressive features in diaphysis/metaphysis of long bonesIn long bones: Generally composed of fragments and nodules of bland hyaline cartilage, often with thin, pink seam of peripheral boneChondrocyte cellularity is often low and with minimal or no nuclear atypiaIn small bones of hands and feet: Often much more cellular and may demonstrate mild nuclear atypia and myxoid matrix degenerationClinical and radiologic correlation to evaluate for pathologic cortical bone disruption and soft tissue extension is most helpful in excluding chondrosarcomaIn some cases, it can be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to histologically distinguish enchondroma from low-grade chondrosarcomaCorrelation with imaging is often critical in making this distinctionIn ambiguous cases, a diagnosis of \"low-grade cartilaginous lesion, final diagnosis deferred to permanent sections\" is appropriateAny subsequent curetted tissue should be submitted for permanent histologic evaluationChondrosarcomaOften painfulThe majority of patients are > 50 years oldImaging generally shows irregular, large, and destructive tumor, often with cortical disruption and soft tissue extension, involving metaphysis/diaphysis of long bonesClear cell chondrosarcoma (variant) characteristically arises in epiphysis of long bonesCellularity and chondrocyte nuclear atypia vary widely, depending on grade, but most cases show a higher degree of both than is seen in benign cartilage or enchondromaChondrocyte necrosis and prominent matrix degeneration are also more common in chondrosarcomaIn some cases, a definitive diagnosis of a low-grade lesion will not be possible on frozen sectionChondrosarcoma of small bones of the hands and feet is very rare and requires evidence of true bony or soft tissue invasion for diagnosisDedifferentiated chondrosarcoma may show cellular, noncartilaginous high-grade sarcoma or neoplastic cartilage or both, depending on what portion of

contemporary 10-year local recurrence rate ranges from 5-10%A positive margin is associated with a 2x increase in the risk of local recurrenceFor invasive carcinoma, consensus guidelines define

section is generally not practical in time allotted for breast surgeryIn some BCS, additional shave margins are taken after the main excision is removedThis reduces some sources of false-positive margins, such as ink leakage into tissue cracksThe orientation of each margin is clearer to both the surgeon and the pathologist as compared to the pathologist inking a specimen based on suture

margins in 1 BCS, many techniques are being developed that allow the surgeon to distinguish carcinoma from normal tissue in the operating roomMarginProbe (Dion Technologies) is currently the only one

normal tissue due to differences in ion concentration, ion mobility, metabolism, water content, and cellular structureHowever, some benign lesions can have similar propertiesThe surgeon scans the

required to assess an entire specimenIf a positive signal is received, the surgeon removes a shave margin in this areaIn order to maximize sensitivity to detect all cancers, specificity is lower, resulting in a false-positive rate of ~ 30-50%This may lead to removing more tissue than necessaryIn multiple studies, the use of the device decreased the need for reexcision when the initial rate was highThe utility in centers with initially low reexcision rates is questionedThe reported cost is also a concern: Reported to be ~ $20,000 USD for the device and ~ $1,000 USD for the probe used in each

increased intracranial pressure (headache, nausea/vomiting, impaired consciousness, new cranial nerve deficits)Patients with a known systemic disease and suspected brain involvement require diagnosisPrimary systemic malignancy with suspicion for CNS involvementImmunocompromised patients (e.g., HIV/AIDS, organ transplant) at risk for opportunistic infectionPatients with a clinical

diagnosis should be avoided due to infectious risk of prion disease and low diagnostic yieldFrozen tissue should be saved for molecular analysis with remaining tissue treated with formic acidVasculitis: Levels on paraffin block are more useful for diagnosis of focal lesionsSPECIMEN EVALUATIONNeuroimaging FindingsImaging findings are very helpful in suggesting the most likely diagnosis and the duration of the diseaseNeuroanatomic localization and signal characteristics impact differential diagnosisMass effect, cystic/solid nature, presence of hydrocephalus, thinning of overlying bone, and loss of cerebral parenchymal volume are all importantClinical PresentationThe combination of imaging features and clinical presentation can narrow the differential diagnosis and help to determine whether the sample is representative of the disease or whether additional samples should be requestedThe pathologist uses this information to determine if a specimen is sufficient for diagnosisExamplesDiagnostic sample: Highly cellular neoplasm in a patient who presents with a centrally necrotic cerebral tumorNondiagnostic sample: Rare atypical cells in a patient who presents with a centrally necrotic cerebral tumorGrossThere are usually very few distinctive macroscopic characteristicsGliomas: Gray-translucent, soft, gelatinous textureMetastatic carcinoma: Red or tan, gritty consistencyAbscesses: Purulent, sometimes with fibrous wallLesional tissue needs to be distinguished from normalNormal cortex: Gray, soft consistencyNormal white matter: Chalky white, homogeneous, soft consistencyFrozen SectionIt is important to not use the entire specimen as additional tissue may not be available for other studiesA minute portion of the specimen is taken for cytologic preparationIf a core biopsy is provided, a small fragment from each end of the core is usedIf a large specimen is provided, several small fragments should be reserved for smear preparationFrozen section methodTissue to be frozen is perched on a small bead of embedding medium but not covered with mediumTissue is frozen quickly with a light touch of a metal heat extractor or cryospray to avoid ice crystals in tissueThe block is carefully step sectioned to preserve tissue when making slidesIn some cases, cytologic preparations without frozen sections may be preferableVery small specimens, suspected infection, or specimens with calcificationsCytologic PreparationsSmear method1- to 3-pinhead-sized fragments are placed 1/3 of the way down on the glass slideIn general, the smaller the fragment, the better the smearA 2nd slide is used to firmly but evenly smear tissue on the slide, which is then immediately fixed in 95% ethanol, and stained with H&ESlides should be held above a fixative container to avoid any delay in fixationAir drying distorts cytology and can generate misleading artifactsInsufficient force will lead to obscured, overlapping regions, while excessive force will cause streaking, which will distort cytomorphologySmear characteristics: The perceived consistency of the tissue between glass slides while making the smear can be very informative as to the nature of the lesionSchwannomas and fibroblastic meningiomas are firm and difficult to smearCrunching \"sand\" between glass suggests calcificationsSoft, highly cellular tumors, such as pituitary adenomas, smear easily in single cell layerAfter staining, the slide is inspected to identify how evenly tissue has been smearedTouch preparation methodUse for firm/calcified/fibrous lesionsTissue is gently and rapidly touched (held gently in forceps) once to slide surfaceSlide is placed immediately in fixative to avoid drying artifactThe entire slide is carefully reviewed as lesions may be

(PNET), metastasis, lymphoma] vs. ependymomaPilocytic astrocytoma (bipolar cytomorphology, Rosenthal fibers) in astrocytic lesion with microvascular proliferation so as not to overgradeMOST COMMON DIAGNOSESDiffusely Infiltrating GliomasDiffusely infiltrating gliomas are a heterogeneous group of increasingly molecularly defined tumors, which cannot be reliably distinguished by morphology aloneHigh-grade histologic features overlap across all tumor types and include increased mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation/endothelial cell hyperplasia, and spontaneous necrosis (especially in a palisading pattern)Adult infiltrating gliomas are divided into 3 major molecularly defined categories: IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, IDH-mutant astrocytoma, and IDH-mutant oligodendrogliomaPediatric and young adult diffuse gliomas are uncommon and divided into a low-grade group and a high-grade group, defined by molecular alterations &/or the presence of high-grade histologic featuresPediatric low-grade gliomas most commonly harbor MAPK pathway gene alterations [polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumor of the young (PLNTY), diffuse low-grade glioma MAPK pathway-altered], or MYB/MYBL1 rearrangements (angiocentric glioma, diffuse astrocytoma MYB/MYBL1-altered)Pediatric diffuse high-grade gliomas harbor histone 3 subunit mutations (diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27-altered, diffuse hemispheric glioma, H3 G34-mutant), activating RTK gene fusions (infant-type hemispheric glioma), or high-grade histology without histone 3 subunit or IDH mutation (diffuse pediatric-type high-grade glioma, H3-wildtype and IDH-wildtype)Glioblastoma, CNS WHO grade 4 (IDH wildtype)Lacks IDH mutation; diagnosis may be rendered by the presence of high-grade histologic features or molecular featuresEGFR amplification, TERT promoter mutation, or concurrent polysomy 7 and monosomy 10 are molecular criteria for glioblastoma in IDH-wildtype infiltrating gliomaMR findings: Typically show ring enhancement with a central core of necrosis; may cross corpus callosum (\"butterfly\")Frozen sectionHypercellularity and infiltrative growth around normal brain structures are best seen on frozen sectionSpontaneous necrosis, especially palisading necrosis &/or glomeruloid microvascular proliferationMicrovascular thrombi are a strong predictor of IDH-wildtype statusSmearAbundant fibrillary glial cell processesMitotic figures, nuclear atypia, and pleomorphism best seen on smearSpindled, gemistocytic, epithelioid, small cell, and giant cell cytologies are commonly encounteredGlioblastomas with sarcomatoid differentiation may smear poorlyMarked variability in tumor morphology, both between and within tumorsAstrocytoma, IDH mutant, CNS WHO grades 2-4Defined molecularly by the presence of activating IDH1 or IDH2 mutation without concurrent chromosomal arm 1p19q codeletionMR findings: Hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2, with relative FLAIR hypointensity, typically nonenhancing; enhancement suggests a high-grade componentEnriched for frontal lobe locationsIncreased mitotic activity indicates grade 3, while necrosis, microvascular proliferation, or homozygous deletion of CDKN2A indicates grade 4Frozen sectionOften edematous or with abundant mucinous microcysts, leading to significant freezing artifactLower grade tumors often show only a mild increase in cellularity relative to normal brainFine calcifications may be seen on occasionSmearCytology is often bland and may resemble a normal brain with only rare cells with mild cytologic atypiaSignificant morphologic overlap with oligodendroglioma, often with less rounded nuclei and more prominent fine glial processesGemistocytic cytomorphology, when present, may be helpful in confirming tumor but should be carefully distinguished from reactive astrogliosisSpecimens are often inconclusive intraoperatively and may be reported descriptively (e.g., \"mildly hypercellular cellular brain parenchyma, suspicious for glioma\")Oligodendroglioma, CNS WHO grades 2-3 (IDH mutant)Oligodendrogliomas are molecularly defined by the presence of pathogenic IDH1 or IDH2 mutation with concurrent chromosomal arm 1p19q codeletionMR findings: Hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2; enhancement suggests high-grade featuresCriteria for WHO grade 3 (formerly anaplastic) oligodendroglioma are not well-established, but increased mitotic activity, necrosis, and microvascular proliferation suggest aggressive behaviorFrozen sectionAn infiltrating glial neoplasm with monomorphic, round nuclei with chicken-wire branched capillariesThe classic fried-egg appearance is a consequence of formalin fixation and is not seen on frozen sectionNumerous tumor cells surrounding individual neurons (\"satellitosis\") is particularly common in oligodendrogliomasMicrocystic architecture and calcifications are common in solid areasSmearA monomorphic population of round cells with scant, often imperceptible cytoplasmIn contrast to other glial tumors, tumor cells do not usually show fibrillary processes but may arise in a background of astrogliosisMay be difficult to distinguish from other low-grade infiltrating gliomas but not necessary at time of frozen sectionPitfallsSamples taken too superficially may show minimal invasion of brain by tumor, while samples taken from too deep in high-grade lesions may demonstrate necrosis without viable cellsEpithelioid glioblastomas may be difficult to distinguish from carcinomas; acceptable to report as \"malignant epithelioid neoplasm\" as surgical management is similarSmall cell glioblastomas may be difficult to distinguish from lymphomasDue to the difference in management, concern for lymphoma should be discussed with the surgeon, and flow cytometry may be consideredDemyelinating disease is a notorious mimic for glioblastoma, both by imaging and histology; the presence of abundant, foamy macrophages should raise concern for demyelination rather than gliomaDemyelinating disease may demonstrate marked reactive-type atypia, and delicate mitotic figures (\"Creutzfeldt cells\") may be counteredReportingDistinguishing molecular-defined entities is not possible at frozen sectionTumors without high-grade features should be reported as \"glioma, no high-grade features seen\" due to the potential for heterogeneity in sampling and the possibility of high-grade molecular featuresPilocytic Astrocytoma, CNS WHO Grade 1Frozen section and smearGlial cells with coarse, hair-like, bipolar fibrillary processes; best seen on smear preparationBiphasic architecture; composed of compact regions with Rosenthal fibers or eosinophilic granular bodies and loose regions with oligoid cytologyTufted capillary microvasculature is

          "SPECIMEN EVALUATION": "Neuroimaging FindingsImaging findings are very helpful in suggesting the most likely diagnosis and the duration of the diseaseNeuroanatomic localization and signal characteristics impact differential diagnosisMass effect, cystic/solid nature, presence of hydrocephalus, thinning of overlying bone, and loss of cerebral parenchymal volume are all importantClinical PresentationThe combination of imaging features and clinical presentation can narrow the differential diagnosis and help to determine whether the sample is representative of the disease or whether additional samples should be requestedThe pathologist uses this information to determine if a specimen is sufficient for diagnosisExamplesDiagnostic sample: Highly cellular neoplasm in a patient who presents with a centrally necrotic cerebral tumorNondiagnostic sample: Rare atypical cells in a patient who presents with a centrally necrotic cerebral tumorGrossThere are usually very few distinctive macroscopic characteristicsGliomas: Gray-translucent, soft, gelatinous textureMetastatic carcinoma: Red or tan, gritty consistencyAbscesses: Purulent, sometimes with fibrous wallLesional tissue needs to be distinguished from normalNormal cortex: Gray, soft consistencyNormal white matter: Chalky white, homogeneous, soft consistencyFrozen SectionIt is important to not use the entire specimen as additional tissue may not be available for other studiesA minute portion of the specimen is taken for cytologic preparationIf a core biopsy is provided, a small fragment from each end of the core is usedIf a large specimen is provided, several small fragments should be reserved for smear preparationFrozen section methodTissue to be frozen is perched on a small bead of embedding medium but not covered with mediumTissue is frozen quickly with a light touch of a metal heat extractor or cryospray to avoid ice crystals in tissueThe block is carefully step sectioned to preserve tissue when making slidesIn some cases, cytologic preparations without frozen sections may be preferableVery small specimens, suspected infection, or specimens with calcificationsCytologic PreparationsSmear method1- to 3-pinhead-sized fragments are placed 1/3 of the way down on the glass slideIn general, the smaller the fragment, the better the smearA 2nd slide is used to firmly but evenly smear tissue on the slide, which is then immediately fixed in 95% ethanol, and stained with H&ESlides should be held above a fixative container to avoid any delay in fixationAir drying distorts cytology and can generate misleading artifactsInsufficient force will lead to obscured, overlapping regions, while excessive force will cause streaking, which will distort cytomorphologySmear characteristics: The perceived consistency of the tissue between glass slides while making the smear can be very informative as to the nature of the lesionSchwannomas and fibroblastic meningiomas are firm and difficult to smearCrunching \"sand\" between glass suggests calcificationsSoft, highly cellular tumors, such as pituitary adenomas, smear easily in single cell layerAfter staining, the slide is inspected to identify how evenly tissue has been smearedTouch preparation methodUse for firm/calcified/fibrous lesionsTissue is gently and rapidly touched (held gently in forceps) once to slide surfaceSlide is placed immediately in fixative to avoid drying artifactThe entire slide is carefully reviewed as lesions may be heterogeneousDiagnostic cells sometimes can be pulled out toward the end of the smearImportant adjunct to a diagnosis ofSmall blue cell tumor with little cytoplasm [primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), metastasis, lymphoma] vs. ependymomaPilocytic astrocytoma (bipolar cytomorphology, Rosenthal fibers) in astrocytic lesion with microvascular proliferation so as not to overgrade",
          "MOST COMMON DIAGNOSES": "Diffusely Infiltrating GliomasDiffusely infiltrating gliomas are a heterogeneous group of increasingly molecularly defined tumors, which cannot be reliably distinguished by morphology aloneHigh-grade histologic features overlap across all tumor types and include increased mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation/endothelial cell hyperplasia, and spontaneous necrosis (especially in a palisading pattern)Adult infiltrating gliomas are divided into 3 major molecularly defined categories: IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, IDH-mutant astrocytoma, and IDH-mutant oligodendrogliomaPediatric and young adult diffuse gliomas are uncommon and divided into a low-grade group and a high-grade group, defined by molecular alterations &/or the presence of high-grade histologic featuresPediatric low-grade gliomas most commonly harbor MAPK pathway gene alterations [polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumor of the young (PLNTY), diffuse low-grade glioma MAPK pathway-altered], or MYB/MYBL1 rearrangements (angiocentric glioma, diffuse astrocytoma MYB/MYBL1-altered)Pediatric diffuse high-grade gliomas harbor histone 3 subunit mutations (diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27-altered, diffuse hemispheric glioma, H3 G34-mutant), activating RTK gene fusions (infant-type hemispheric glioma), or high-grade histology without histone 3 subunit or IDH mutation (diffuse pediatric-type high-grade glioma, H3-wildtype and IDH-wildtype)Glioblastoma, CNS WHO grade 4 (IDH wildtype)Lacks IDH mutation; diagnosis may be rendered by the presence of high-grade histologic features or molecular featuresEGFR amplification, TERT promoter mutation, or concurrent polysomy 7 and monosomy 10 are molecular criteria for glioblastoma in IDH-wildtype infiltrating gliomaMR findings: Typically show ring enhancement with a central core of necrosis; may cross corpus callosum (\"butterfly\")Frozen sectionHypercellularity and infiltrative growth around normal brain structures are best seen on frozen sectionSpontaneous necrosis, especially palisading necrosis &/or glomeruloid microvascular proliferationMicrovascular thrombi are a strong predictor of IDH-wildtype statusSmearAbundant fibrillary glial cell processesMitotic figures, nuclear atypia, and pleomorphism best seen on smearSpindled, gemistocytic, epithelioid, small cell, and giant cell cytologies are commonly encounteredGlioblastomas with sarcomatoid differentiation may smear poorlyMarked variability in tumor morphology, both between and within tumorsAstrocytoma, IDH mutant, CNS WHO grades 2-4Defined molecularly by the presence of activating IDH1 or IDH2 mutation without concurrent chromosomal arm 1p19q codeletionMR findings: Hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2, with relative FLAIR hypointensity, typically nonenhancing; enhancement suggests a high-grade componentEnriched for frontal lobe locationsIncreased mitotic activity indicates grade 3, while necrosis, microvascular proliferation, or homozygous deletion of CDKN2A indicates grade 4Frozen sectionOften edematous or with abundant mucinous microcysts, leading to significant freezing artifactLower grade tumors often show only a mild increase in cellularity relative to normal brainFine calcifications may be seen on occasionSmearCytology is often bland and may resemble a normal brain with only rare cells with mild cytologic atypiaSignificant morphologic overlap with oligodendroglioma, often with less rounded nuclei and more prominent fine glial processesGemistocytic cytomorphology, when present, may be helpful in confirming tumor but should be carefully distinguished from reactive astrogliosisSpecimens are often inconclusive intraoperatively and may be reported descriptively (e.g., \"mildly hypercellular cellular brain parenchyma, suspicious for glioma\")Oligodendroglioma, CNS WHO grades 2-3 (IDH mutant)Oligodendrogliomas are molecularly defined by the presence of pathogenic IDH1 or IDH2 mutation with concurrent chromosomal arm 1p19q codeletionMR findings: Hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2; enhancement suggests high-grade featuresCriteria for WHO grade 3 (formerly anaplastic) oligodendroglioma are not well-established, but increased mitotic activity, necrosis, and microvascular proliferation suggest aggressive behaviorFrozen sectionAn infiltrating glial neoplasm with monomorphic, round nuclei with chicken-wire branched capillariesThe classic fried-egg appearance is a consequence of formalin fixation and is not seen on frozen sectionNumerous tumor cells surrounding individual neurons (\"satellitosis\") is particularly common in oligodendrogliomasMicrocystic architecture and calcifications are common in solid areasSmearA monomorphic population of round cells with scant, often imperceptible cytoplasmIn contrast to other glial tumors, tumor cells do not usually show fibrillary processes but may arise in a background of astrogliosisMay be difficult to distinguish from other low-grade infiltrating gliomas but not necessary at time of frozen sectionPitfallsSamples taken too superficially may show minimal invasion of brain by tumor, while samples taken from too deep in high-grade lesions may demonstrate necrosis without viable cellsEpithelioid glioblastomas may be difficult to distinguish from carcinomas; acceptable to report as \"malignant epithelioid neoplasm\" as surgical management is similarSmall cell glioblastomas may be difficult to distinguish from lymphomasDue to the difference in management, concern for lymphoma should be discussed with the surgeon, and flow cytometry may be consideredDemyelinating disease is a notorious mimic for glioblastoma, both by imaging and histology; the presence of abundant, foamy macrophages should raise concern for demyelination rather than gliomaDemyelinating disease may demonstrate marked reactive-type atypia, and delicate mitotic figures (\"Creutzfeldt cells\") may be counteredReportingDistinguishing molecular-defined entities is not possible at frozen sectionTumors without high-grade features should be reported as \"glioma, no high-grade features seen\" due to the potential for heterogeneity in sampling and the possibility of high-grade molecular featuresPilocytic Astrocytoma, CNS WHO Grade 1Frozen section and smearGlial cells with coarse, hair-like, bipolar fibrillary processes; best seen on smear preparationBiphasic architecture; composed of compact regions with Rosenthal fibers or eosinophilic granular bodies and loose regions with oligoid cytologyTufted capillary microvasculature is a common feature; may mimic microvascular proliferationDistinguished by a single layer of endothelial cells for each lumenVariable nuclear pleomorphism may be seen; mitotic figures are rare but may be encounteredNecrosis rare (suggests alternative diagnosis)Pilomyxoid astrocytomas are now considered a subtype of pilocytic astrocytoma due to significant molecular overlapFound in optic

cellular with perivascular pseudorosettes, true ependymal rosettes, and small intracytoplasmic luminaCiliated ependymal surfaces may be seen but are often distorted on frozen sectionSome ependymomas may have areas of subependymoma (i.e., mixed ependymoma/subependymoma tumor)SmearGlial tumor cells with bland oval nuclei, often with inconspicuous nucleoliCytoplasmic processes, radially arranged around blood vesselsOccasional intracytoplasmic lumina as well as cilia and terminal bars (blepharoplasts) in tubulesPitfallDefinitive diagnosis of ependymoma should be rendered during frozen section

extraventricularSmear and frozen sectionSmall round neurocytic cells, which may be mistaken for oligodendroglial cellsOften with perinuclear halos and fine capillary networkMay be impossible to distinguish from oligodendroglioma on frozen sectionIncreased mitotic activity is seen in atypical central neurocytoma; however, there is currently no change in grading with this entityIndistinguishable from most pineal parenchymal tumors by morphology, but anatomic location may help in differentiatingCNS Embryonal TumorsA heterogeneous family of high-grade tumors with predominantly primitive neuronal lineages with overlapping morphologic featuresFrozen section: Sheets of primitive small blue cells, areas of necrosis; some entities may demonstrate perivascular or neuropil-laden rosettes or spongioblastic architectureSmear: Primitive small blue cells with scant cytoplasm and round or carrot-shaped nuclei with frequent mitotic figures and apoptotic bodiesMay be difficult to distinguish from small cell glioblastoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, or lymphoma intraoperativelyReport as \"small blue cell tumor\"Other Primary Neuroepithelial TumorsPleomorphic

intraoperatively, although not necessaryFrozen section: Nests or papillae of epithelium arranged in a basaloid patternPitfallLongstanding compression of the hypothalamus can induce coarse gliosis with Rosenthal fibers (\"piloid gliosis\"), which may be mistaken for pilocytic astrocytomaIf only keratin contents are received, they may not be distinguishable from dermoid or epidermoid cystsGerm Cell TumorsUsually midline (sellar/suprasellar, pineal region) in children and young adultsFrozen section and smear: Pure germinoma, pure teratoma, or mixed with choriocarcinomatous and endodermal sinus

determine if a tumor is presentChange in Patient ManagementIf a tumor is diagnosed, additional tissue may be removed as gross total resection can be curative for low-grade tumorsClinical SettingEligible patientsPatients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy who have failed several drug regimensThey are at increased risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP)Patients with mesial temporal sclerosis to remove sclerosed hippocampusPatients with vascular malformations causing seizuresPatients with specific conditions, such as Rasmussen encephalitis or tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)Surgery is performed to remove the lesion causing seizures~ 5-10% of patients with seizures undergo surgeryAfter surgery, ~ 60% of patients are seizure free, depending on the etiology and extent of resectionPatients whose seizures persist after surgery have an increased risk of SUDEPThe majority of epileptogenic lesions are in the temporal lobe (64%), followed by frontal lobe (16%), parietal lobe (9%), and occipital lobe (6%)It is important for the pathologist to be aware of radiologic findings before intraoperative consultationIf a radiologic correlate for the seizure focus is seen, the differential diagnosis is based on the imaging appearanceFor example, hippocampal (mesial temporal) sclerosis is usually identified before surgeryRadiologic correlation can aid in avoiding mistaking

surgeon may ask for frozen section of the renal neoplasm to determine diagnosisMOST COMMON DIAGNOSESClear Cell Renal Cell CarcinomaMost common type of RCCWell-circumscribed or lobulated golden yellow to red mass with pushing borders, often with areas of hemorrhage and cystic degenerationGray or tan-white fleshy-appearing areas may represent areas of sarcomatoid differentiationCells have clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm and are arranged in nests or solid sheets with a characteristic delicate fibrovascular networkSmall subset of clear cell RCC may have a predominantly cystic morphology with areas of regression, mimicking a multilocular cystic renal neoplasm of low malignant potential (MCRNLMP) on limited samplingNuclear grade ranges from low to high based on prominence of nucleoli for WHO/ISUP grades 1-3 and nuclear pleomorphism, sarcomatoid, or rhabdoid differentiation for WHO/ISUP grade 4Areas with darker, eosinophilic cytoplasm are usually higher gradePapillary Renal Cell Carcinoma2nd most common type of RCCTumors are often well circumscribed, have variation in color depending on amount of hemosiderin-laden macrophages and foamy histiocytes present, and may appear friableTumors may have papillary, solid, or tubular architectureFoamy histiocytes within papillary cores, hemosiderin-laden macrophages, and psammomatous calcifications may be presentAmphiphilic to eosinophilic cytoplasm with clear cytoplasm being focally present or absentAreas with clear cytoplasm are usually in areas of hemorrhage or hypoxiaFumarate hydratase (FH)-deficient RCC may have overlapping features with papillary RCC with eosinophilic cytoplasm, but FH-deficient tumors characteristically have a mixture of architectures, viral inclusion-like nucleoli, and absent FH &/or positive 2SC immunohistochemical stainingUncommonly, cases of papillary RCC can have oncocytic cytoplasm and be confused for an oncocytic renal neoplasm when only a small sample is presentClear Cell Papillary Renal Cell CarcinomaWell-circumscribed tumors, often cystic on gross examinationCells with low-grade cytology and clear cytoplasm arranged in papillary, branching tubules, cysts, or solid acinar patternsDespite name, papillary architecture may be minor componentCharacteristic finding is linear arrangement of nuclei near apical aspect of cells but may be absent in some casesThe histologic features may overlap with that of clear cell RCCDeferment to permanent sections for immunohistochemistry for CK7 (diffuse or near-diffuse positive), CAIX (cup-like), and GATA3 may be required in most casesChromophobe Renal Cell CarcinomaWell-circumscribed tan to brown homogeneous mass, which may have central scar, hemorrhage, or necrosisMost have solid growth pattern with incomplete fibrovascular septa, but nested, cystic, and other patterns may be presentIrregular wrinkled nuclei (raisinoid) and binucleated cells with perinuclear halosAbundant, granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent cell membranesEosinophilic variant tends to have fewer perinuclear halos and raisinoid nucleiOncocytomaWell-circumscribed tan to dark brown mass with central scar, which can resemble chromophobe RCC grosslyUsual pattern is of nests of cells, cysts, and tubules in hypocellular stromaRound, regular nuclei with vesicular chromatin and central nucleoli and eosinophilic granular cytoplasmBenign neoplasms but, on small sampling, can have overlapping features with other renal neoplasms with oncocytic cytoplasm, such as chromophobe RCCCaution should be made when giving a definite diagnosis of oncocytoma on frozen sectionUrothelial Cell CarcinomaPapillary lesions filling the renal pelvis pose little diagnostic challengeInfiltrative UCC may result in a mass lesion in the kidney and can be diagnostically challenging to differentiate from a centrally located high-grade RCCBoth histologically appear as infiltrative high-grade carcinomas, usually with a desmoplastic stromal responseBoth urothelial carcinoma and RCC can have sarcomatoid &/or rhabdoid differentiationUCC in situ &/or papillary UCC within the renal pelvis offer diagnostic clues to a diagnosis of UCC but may not be identified on limited samplingIn difficult cases, the diagnosis may need to be deferred for immunohistochemical staining (PAX8/GATA3/p63) to differentiate from RCCFumarate Hydratase-Deficient Renal Cell CarcinomaMajority of cases are associated with a germline FH mutation and hereditary leiomyomatosis and RCC syndrome (HLRCC), but sporadic cases due to somatic FH mutations also occurShows mixed morphologies, including papillary, tubulocystic, solid, cribriform/sieve-like, nests with desmoplasia, and intracystic papillaryHallmark feature is a viral inclusion-like prominent nucleolus with perinucleolar halo but may be only focally identifiedWhile a frozen section diagnosis of high-grade RCC may be made, definitive classification should be deferred for confirmation with immunohistochemical stainingLoss of FH staining in the majority of cases and positive staining with 2SCMultilocular Cystic Renal Neoplasm of Low Malignant PotentialGross appearance is of a multiloculated cystic lesion with no solid nodulesHistologically, the cysts are lined by a single layer of cells with clear cytoplasm and low-grade nuclear features and only single cells or small, nonexpansile clusters of tumor cells within the fibrous septaClear cell RCC can have predominantly cystic morphology with areas of regression, and extensive sampling may be required to find focal solid nests of clear cells, limiting the ability to give a definitive diagnosis on frozen sectionMixed Epithelial and Stromal TumorUncommon benign tumors, commonly located in the hilum, that are most common in perimenopausal womenMorphologic spectrum ranges from predominantly cystic (sometimes called adult cystic nephroma) to tumors with both solid and cystic componentsCysts are lined by a single layer of flat, cuboidal, or hobnail epithelium with bland nuclear featuresFibrous septa and solid areas are composed of fibrous or ovarian-type stroma or smooth muscleAngiomyolipomaUsually well circumscribed with gross appearance depending on proportion of adipose tissue, smooth muscle, and blood vessels presentImaging findings may be diagnostic due to admixture of adipose tissueIf the smooth muscle component is dominant, the imaging appearance can resemble RCCConsists of varying proportions of dystrophic blood vessels, smooth muscle, and adipose tissueBlood vessels have thick hyalinized walls with spindle cells radiating outward from vascular wallCare must be made not to overdiagnose areas of spindle component as sarcomatoid RCC or adipose-predominant angiomyolipoma (AML) as well-differentiated liposarcoma on frozen sectionThe spindle cells of AML will not show nuclear atypia, increased mitoses, or necrosisEpithelioid AMLs may be composed of cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent nuclear pleomorphism, which may mimic RCCAML with epithelial cysts (AMLEC) is a rare variant of AML that may mimic cystic tumors, such as mixed epithelial and stromal tumorMalakoplakiaForms small, soft yellow plaques and nodulesSheets of eosinophilic histiocytes (von Hansemann cells) with intracytoplasmic targetoid basophilic inclusions (Michaelis-Guttman bodies) and admixed acute and chronic inflammationMay occasionally have associated fibrosis or spindled appearanceXanthogranulomatous PyelonephritisAssociated with urinary tract obstruction and staghorn calculi; may form single or multiple golden yellow grossly identified lesionsSheets of cytologically bland foamy histiocytes associated with a mixed inflammatory infiltrateHistiocytes with foamy cytoplasm may superficially mimic a clear cell RCC but lack the delicate network of fibrovascular septa of a clear cell RCCCystsRenal cysts can be congenital, sporadic, or acquired due to long-term hemodialysis and, histologically, are lined by a single layer of flat or cuboidal cytologically bland epithelial cellsHemorrhage &/or inflammatory changes can make distinction from solid neoplasms difficult by imagingRCC can have extensive necrosis and appear cystic with gross appearance, mimicking hemorrhagic simple cystCysts should be carefully examined for mural nodules or papillary projections, which may be only focally present in a cystic, necrotic RCCPapillary AdenomasBenign, usually incidental lesions; may be multipleAdenomas are nonencapsulated neoplasms < 15 mm in size with papillary &/or tubular architecture and low-grade nucleiMay be difficult to distinguish from low-grade carcinoma when present at parenchymal margin on frozen sectionLymphomaUsually occurs as secondary involvement in systemic diseaseMany patients will have retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, or a prior history of lymphomaMay have bilateral renal involvementMost common type of lymphoma is diffuse large B-cell typeHomogeneous gray to white mass involving cortex or medullaMay form a distinct mass or diffusely involve the entire kidneyExtensive necrosis may be present, making interpretation of frozen sections difficultMetastasesOften, prior clinical history of malignancy is present but may present as solitary tumor, mimicking a primary RCC or urothelial carcinomaREPORTINGGrossIf lesion has gross features of RCC, this finding can be reportedGross confirmation of negative parenchymal margin of partial nephrectomy is highly predictive of no residual carcinomaFrozen SectionIf findings characteristic for a specific neoplasm are present, diagnosis may be reportedOften, categorization of lesion as benign or malignant provides surgeon with sufficient informationDistinguishing renal tumors from urothelial carcinoma, when possible, can alter surgical managementIn difficult cases, such as cystic lesions or oncocytic neoplasms, deferment to permanent sections may be necessary and appropriateFor parenchymal margin of partial nephrectomy, presence or absence of tumor at margin should be reportedValue of frozen section evaluation in this setting has been questionedEvaluation of tumor bed by surgeon for complete tumor removal has been shown to be an accurate predictor of negative marginTumor bed biopsies may be more difficult to interpret in the absence of information about primary lesion and distance from marginPITFALLSUrothelial Carcinoma vs. Infiltrative High-Grade Renal Cell CarcinomaBoth UCC and high-grade RCC can present as centrally located renal neoplasmsInfiltrative high-grade RCCs, which may mimic UCC, include FH-deficient RCC, renal medullary carcinoma, RCC with sarcomatoid differentiation, collecting duct carcinoma, and RCC, unclassified typeRenal medullary carcinomas are rare, aggressive neoplasms characteristically occurring in young adults with hemoglobinopathiesBoth UCC and RCC may have extensive areas of sarcomatoid differentiation, and immunohistochemical stains may required to differentiate between the 2 entitiesCollecting duct carcinomas are increasingly rare with recognition of other high-grade RCCsMetastatic carcinomas may also rarely enter into the differential diagnosis of a high-grade, centrally located neoplasmA diagnosis of UCC will result in a nephroureterectomy ± bladder cuff, while RCC will result in a nephrectomyClear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma vs. Other Renal Neoplasms With Predominantly Clear CytoplasmClear cell RCC is most common, but other RCCs with predominantly clear cytoplasm, such as clear cell papillary RCC, or, less commonly, MCRNLMP, RCC with fibromyomatous stroma, and MiTF translocation-associated RCC, must also be consideredIn most cases, further classification is not required on frozen sectionRenal Neoplasms With Oncocytic CytoplasmClassically, the differential diagnosis has been between oncocytoma and chromophobe RCC, but there has been a recent expansion of renal neoplasms with oncocytic cytoplasmSDH-deficient RCC, eosinophilic solid and cystic RCC (ESC-RCC), and recently described eosinophilic vacuolated tumor (EVT) and low-grade oncocytic tumor (LOT) have broadened the differential diagnosisMany oncocytic neoplasms, including chromophobe RCC, may have areas with similar morphology to oncocytoma, so a diagnosis of oncocytoma on frozen section should be made with cautionA diagnosis of renal neoplasm with oncocytic features/cytoplasm is often sufficient on frozen sectionCystic LesionsCystic &/or necrotic RCC can be difficult to differentiate from hemorrhagic cysts on frozen sectionFrozen section diagnosis of \"cystic lesion\" with final deferment to permanent sections is appropriateCrush ArtifactCrushed benign renal tubules can be difficult to interpret in parenchymal margin sectionsFeatures supporting benign tubules are absence of nuclear atypia and the presence of glomeruli in adjacent tissueLesions With Foamy CytoplasmBenign lesions containing histiocytes with foamy or eosinophilic cytoplasm, such as malakoplakia or xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, may be

removal by the surgeonChange in Patient ManagementIf malignancy is identified, the surgeon may elect to perform a lobectomy &/or sample lymph nodesMore limited surgery may be considered for adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA)However, a definitive diagnosis of AIS or MIA requires evaluation of the entire lesion on permanent sectionsA decision to alter the surgical approach requires clinical judgment based on a constellation of featuresIf a lesion cannot be identified in the specimen, the possibility that the lesion was not removed must be consideredClinical SettingAsymptomatic lung lesions may be detected when patients undergo lung cancer screeningThe United States Preventative Services Task Force has issued recommendations for screeningAnnual low-dose CT is recommended for individuals between the ages of 50-80 years with a 20 pack-year history of smoking exposure who currently smoke or have quit smoking within the last 15 yearsIncidental lung lesions may also be detected when patients undergo CT examination for other reasonsLung imaging by CT can detect small lesions (< 2 cm) and lesions of low density (ground-glass opacities)Lesions that require excision includeLesions increasing in sizeSolid or partially solid masses~ 75% are carcinoma and 25% are benign lesionsDiagnosis of small lesions and ground-glass opacities by needle biopsy can be difficultGround-glass opacity consists of an area of increased hazy density with preserved bronchial and vascular markingsMay be due to thickened alveolar septa or partial filling of air spaces with cells, fluid, or debrisAdequate sampling for definitive diagnosis is difficultSmall lesions can be difficult to target preciselyA wedge resection can be appropriate when the following criteria are consideredImaging shows a lesion of low risk for invasive carcinomaDiagnosis is expected to be AIS or MIA100% survival with excision onlyLymph nodes are not involvedThe surgeon must be aware that AIS and MIA can only be diagnosed after complete evaluation of the specimen on permanent sectionsPatient has limited lung capacity or other comorbidityContralateral lung surgery is plannedPatient preferenceSmall masses and ground-glass opacities may be difficult or impossible to identify in the lung during operationIn open resections, the surgeon may not be able to detect lesion by palpation with confidenceIn image-guided video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (iVATS), the lung is not accessible for palpationMultiple methods have been developed to assist in intraoperative identification of the lesionIntraoperative ultrasoundInjection of dye or fluorophorePlacement of hook wires, T bars, microcoils, or radioactive seedsThese methods can be used singly or in combinationA single marker can be used to localize a lesionAlternatively, 2 markers or a marker and dye can be used to mark the borders of a lesion or 2 separate lesionsThe surgeon performs the wedge resection to remove the area of the markersSPECIMEN EVALUATIONSpecimen RadiographA specimen radiograph may be performedCan document the presence of a radiopaque markerThe targeted lesion is unlikely to be seen due to the collapse of surrounding lung tissueGrossThe area indicated by the marker or dye is identified in the specimenThe intact specimen is gently palpated to attempt to identify the lesionIf the lesion is palpable, the location is noted with respect to the marker or dyePleura adjacent to the mass is inspected to determine if the lesion involves pleura or if pleura is freely mobile over the lesionIf a palpable mass is identified, the specimen is incised through the massThe entire mass is serially sectionedCarcinomas can be associated with fibrotic scarsThe presence of a firm mass adjacent to a scar is suggestive of carcinomaAll areas grossly suspicious for carcinoma should be evaluated by frozen sectionThe size of the mass and relationship to margin and pleura are notedRepresentative section(s) of mass and closest margin are taken for frozen sectionIf a palpable mass is not identified, the specimen is serially sectioned and each section carefully examined for visible lesions and gently palpatedThe lesion may be a subtle area of slightly increased firmness, paler in color than surrounding lung parenchymaFrozen SectionA representative section of the lesion is taken for frozen sectionIf carcinoma is identified, the closest margin should be examined by frozen section unless lobectomy is plannedThere are 2 methods to evaluate the marginThe standard method is to cut away the staple line and remove as little lung tissue with staples as possibleExposed lung parenchyma is inked to mark the parenchymal marginThe margin is taken as a perpendicular section, including inked tissue edge in area closest to lesionA 2nd method evaluates the tissue within and beyond the staple lineThis method can only be used with stapling devices that do not result in interlocked staplesThe exposed lung parenchyma at the edge of the staple line is inkedThe specimen is serially sectioned, and the margin closest to the lesion identifiedA section is taken perpendicular to the margin using scissors to cut through the staplesTissue is mounted with staples closest to the bladeAs the block is faced, the staples will become evident by grating against the cryostat blade and creating tears in tissueThe block and chuck are removed from the cryostatStaples are removed from tissue with forcepsThe embedding medium stabilizes the tissue and prevents it from being disruptedThe block and chuck are replaced in the cryostatSurface of tissue is covered with embedding medium to refreeze tissueThe blade is replaced or a different area is usedStaples may have caused nicks in bladeDeeper sections showing lesion and margin are takenThis method allows evaluation of the true tissue margin, which is beyond the staple lineMOST COMMON DIAGNOSESAdenocarcinoma In SituLesions classified as AIS have an excellent prognosis100% disease-specific survivalNo nodal involvementDefinitive diagnosis of AIS can only be made after entire lesion is examined on permanent sectionsGross appearance is typically a subtle area of increased density with paler color compared to surrounding lung parenchymaClassification as AIS requiresSolitary lesionSize ≤ 3 cmPure lepidic patternAlveolar walls should be thin or expanded by a lymphocytic infiltrateNot mucinous in type, or only rarelyNo vascular or pleural involvementNo necrosisNo spread through air spacesDefined as tumor cells within air spaces beyond edge of main tumor as determined by gross examination or at low powerMay be seen as ring-like structures (micropapillary pattern), solid nests, or single cellsTumor cells must be distinguished from alveolar macrophagesMacrophages typically have foamy cytoplasm and contain pigmentAIS is often associated with histiocytes in alveolar spacesCan be very difficult to distinguish from artifactual displacement of tumor cellsAIS is distinguished from reactive atypia by nuclear featuresVariation in size (~ 60% of cases)Atypical enlarged and irregular nuclei (~ 80% of cases)Prominent macronucleoli (< 10% of cases)Atypical mitoses (~ 25% of cases)Inflammatory changes, such as granulomatous inflammation, acute inflammation, &/or organizing pneumonia would be more likely to be associated with reactive atypiaAtelectasis after excision may cause the lepidic pattern of AIS to mimic adenocarcinoma associated with a desmoplastic responseMinimally Invasive AdenocarcinomaSome lesions that would otherwise fulfill criteria for AIS have small (< 0.5-cm) foci of invasionA definitive diagnosis of MIA can only be made after complete evaluation of

invades from lung into chest wallMany patients will have received preoperative therapy due to the extent of the tumorChange in Patient ManagementAdditional tissue may be resected to achieve a tumor-free marginResults may allow further intraoperative staging of patientResidual carcinoma at margins may be a poor prognostic factorPatients may receive additional therapyClinical SettingComplete

tissue removed for patients with limited lung capacityUsing the method described above may result in a false-positive marginThe staple line includes 2-3 mm of lung tissue, and the true margin is at the far edgeRemoving staples often results in excessive tearing of tissue, which will then not be suitable for microscopic evaluation or contain artifactsIn selected cases, tissue within the staple line may be examined by frozen sectionThis method can only be used for systems that do not use interlocking staplesIf surgeons request this technique, they must use the correct type of staplesTissue

diagnosis of malignancy is made, additional surgery may be performed to achieve tumor-free margins &/or for stagingSubtyping adenocarcinoma (e.g., acinar, papillary) is not necessary at the time of frozen sectionClinical SettingLung masses may be detected due to symptoms, by screening, or as incidental findingsSymptomatic: Usually larger in size (> 2 cm)Generally diagnosed prior to surgery through transbronchial or CT-guided biopsy and do not necessarily require confirmationScreen detected: Commonly small masses (< 2 cm) or ground-glass opacities (low density)Screening using low-dose CT has been recommended by United States Preventative Services Task Force for persons between ages 55-80 with a 30-year history of smoking who currently smoke or who have quit smoking within the last 15 yearsExcision is often necessary for diagnosis~ 70% primary lung malignancies, ~ 10% metastases, and ~ 20% nonmalignant lesionsMalignancies in this setting are more likely to be adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), or adenocarcinomas with lepidic patternAIS and MIA can only be diagnosed with certainty after complete evaluation of lesion on permanent sectionsIncidental: Lung masses may be detected on CT scans performed for other reasonsSPECIMEN EVALUATIONGrossMasses may be excised by wedge resection, lobectomy, or pneumonectomyThe pleural surface is carefully inspectedAdhesions: May be associated with inflammatory changes or invasion of tumor through pleuraPuckering: Usually due to retraction by carcinoma that has invaded into but not through pleuraPleural invasion is used for staging and is important prognostic factorLymphangitic spread: Extensive lymphovascular invasion is seen as white branching lymphatic channels on the pleural surfaceThe specimen is gently palpated to identify all masses and their relationship to any pleural changesThe pleura will not move freely over carcinomas that have invaded into pleuraThe specimen is completely serially sectioned to reveal any palpated mass and smaller &/or less firm massesAny areas of possible pleural involvement should be preserved for later evaluation by permanent sectionsThe size and location of all masses are recordedThe distance of lesions to parenchymal margins and bronchial margins is recordedFrozen SectionA representative section of the mass is frozenIf the lesion has a \"cheesy\" or necrotic surface, touch preps may be indicated in lieu of frozen sections to avoid potential contamination of the cryostat with infectious organisms (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis)If the mass is close to a surgical margin, the section is taken to demonstrate both the mass and marginCytologyTouch preps of the cut surface of a mass may be helpful if conservation of tumor tissue for permanent section is necessary or if infectious granulomatous disease is possibleIf lymphoma is suspected, fresh tissue is generally sent for additional ancillary testing (e.g., flow cytometry)If infection is suspected due to granulomas and necrosis, frozen sections should be avoided and tissue should be sent for cultureMOST COMMON DIAGNOSESAdenocarcinoma: Conventional/Nonlepidic PatternMost common diagnosisGenerally presents as a solid, discrete massMorphology (glandular vs. solid) depends heavily on the degree of differentiationDesmoplastic stroma or an extensive chronic inflammatory response is often seenMorphologic variants (e.g., papillary, mucinous, micropapillary, and solid with mucin production) are occasionally seenAdenocarcinoma: Lepidic PatternMay be seen on imaging as a ground-glass opacityGrossly forms an ill-defined, firmer area of lung parenchymaMultiple lesions may be presentLymphomas and focal pneumonia can have a similar gross appearanceThe histologic appearance resembles normal lung parenchyma with alveolar walls lined by atypical cellsAdenocarcinoma In Situ and Minimally Invasive AdenocarcinomaAIS and MIA are unlikely to form a mass by imaging and are more likely to present as ground-glass opacityExcellent prognosisMay be treated with limited (sublobar) excision and no sampling of lymph nodesA decision by the surgeon to perform more limited surgery should include consideration of imaging and patient featuresAIS and MIA can only be diagnosed with certainty after complete evaluation of the lesion on permanent sectionsIt is helpful for the pathologist to clearly indicate when AIS and MIA are excluded by frozen sectionClassification as AIS requiresSolitary lesion measuring < 3 cmPure lepidic growth patternNo invasionAbsence of tumor necrosis and invasion of vessels or pleuraAbsence of intraalveolar tumor spread within or beyond the tumor [spread through air spaces (STAS)]However, it is difficult to distinguish this finding from artifactual displacement of tumor cellsMIA is used for lesions that would otherwise qualify for AIS but have small (< 0.5 cm) areas of invasionIn the setting of multiple small invasive foci, the total percentages of invasive foci can be summed and multiplied by overall tumor diameterExample: 10% invasive component in 2-cm tumor = 2 x 0.1 = 0.2 cm estimated size of invasionSquamous Cell CarcinomaMore likely to be centrally located than adenocarcinomasMay have a gritty cut surface depending on the amount of keratin production by tumorSmall Cell CarcinomaRarely resected, as many have

immunohistochemistry is necessary for precise classificationMetastatic Carcinoma/SarcomaPrevious documented history of malignancy (e.g., colonic adenocarcinoma, osteosarcoma) is invaluableMetastatic

with lung carcinomaChondroid HamartomaGenerally small, well circumscribed, and \"pops out\" when sectionedTypically demonstrates a blue-gray, glassy cut surface due to cartilaginous compositionGranulomaUsually small (< 1 cm) and round; may be multipleThe cut surface varies from soft/necrotic to solid/firm to bony/rock hardGranulomas with necrotic/\"cheesy\" cut surface are more likely to contain fungi (e.g., Histoplasma) or mycobacteria, among other organismsTissue should be kept sterile and sent for culturesFrozen sections should be avoided to minimize exposure of personnel

be present at periphery of the tumorCarcinomas that have been treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be largely, or completely, necroticMalignancies (both primary and metastatic) are generally larger than infectious lesionsGranuloma formation on touch prep or frozen section suggests infectious origin, but rare exceptions existTissue should be taken for cultures if an infectious process is suspectedCarcinoid vs. Small Cell CarcinomaA crushed biopsy of a carcinoid tumor can be mistaken for small cell carcinomaIn the absence of necrosis and mitoses, it is preferable to defer a diagnosis

axillary dissection may be performedIf no additional surgery is planned, there is no need for intraoperative evaluationIf lymphoma or infectious disease is detected, tissue is taken for ancillary studiesClinical SettingPatients with breast cancerLymph node evaluation is important for staging and prognosticationA negative SLN is highly predictive of a negative axillaClinical trials (e.g., ACOSOG Z0011) showed no significant survival benefit to completion axillary dissection in early-stage breast cancer patients with 1-2 positive SLNsAs a result, there has been a significant decline in frozen section evaluationIntraoperative SLN evaluation is still utilized in selected patients who would not fit Z0011 inclusion criteria, including those undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapyIn patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the detection of any disease in the SLN may lead to an axillary dissectionConservative management may be considered for low-volume disease (e.g., isolated tumor cells or micrometastasis)SLNs may be identified by injecting a blue dye, a radiolabeled solution (technetium-99), or bothPatients with axillary adenopathyAxillary lymph nodes may be enlarged due to reactive changes, infection, or malignancyAn excision of an axillary node may be performed for intraoperative diagnosisIn many cases, fine-needle aspiration or a core needle biopsy are used for this purposeSPECIMEN EVALUATIONGrossAll nodes are bluntly dissected from the specimen and carefully countedThe number of nodes present and the number with metastases are used to determine the need for additional surgeryIf each node is inked a different color, slices from multiple nodes can be frozen in the same blockThis allows the number of nodes with metastases to be determinedAll fat is trimmed away from the nodesIf a gradient of blue dye is present, the metastasis is most likely at the blue-stained poleEach node is thinly sliced at 2-mm intervalsIf the node is grossly suspicious for lymphoma or granulomatous/infectious disease, preservation of nonfrozen tissue for ancillary studies is helpfulFlow cytometry, frozen tissue (molecular studies), and hematopathology fixatives are used for suspected lymphomaCultures are used for granulomatous/infectious diseaseSLNs identified using technetium-99 do not expose pathology personnel to dangerous levels of radiationSpecial protective equipment or disposal of tissue are not necessaryHowever, if a new or nonstandard technique is utilized, levels of radiation and the resulting risk should be assessedHandling procedures should be approved by the institutional radiation safety officeFrozen SectionIf a grossly evident metastasis is present, only 1 representative section need be frozenScrape or touch preparations can also be used to document an obvious metastasisIf the procedure is an SLN biopsy, all slices of all grossly normal nodes are frozenAt least 1 H&E slide, including a complete cross section of all slices, should be evaluatedIf the purpose is to establish a diagnosis to explain adenopathy, only 1 representative section should be frozenCytologic preparations should be used, when feasible, to preserve tissue for possible ancillary studiesCytologyEach cut surface is scraped with a curved scalpel blade or glass slide and smeared on another slideEach node should be separately evaluatedUseful when either infection or lymphoma is suspectedTouch imprints, rather than scrape preparations, may be more helpful for lymphomaAlternative Method to Frozen Section1-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) is a currently available assay to detect epithelial cels in nodes based on amplification of cytokeratin 19 mRNA (Sysmex Corporation)Assay uses a homogenized tissue lysate of entire nodeThe equipment and reagents are expensive and are only available from one companyUsed as an alternative to frozen section in some countriesBoth OSNA and conventional frozen section detect macrometastases in the majority of cases (> 97%)OSNA detects more micrometastases, but the clinical usefulness of finding small breast cancer metastases is limitedOSNA can only detect epithelial cells in lymph nodesCannot determine the likely origin of the metastatic carcinomaCannot detect rare cytokeratin 19 negative carcinomasCannot diagnosis diseases other than carcinoma (e.g. lymphoma, melanoma, infection)Contamination by nonmalignant epithelial cells is a concernMOST COMMON DIAGNOSESMetastatic Breast CarcinomaMost common carcinoma found in axillary nodes of womenMetastases from the lung (usually ipsilateral) or regional skin cancers are the next most likely primary sitesMetastatic tumor almost always resembles the primaryDuctal and lobular carcinoma are the most common typesPreoperative review of slides or reports can be very helpful for correlationIf a metastatic tumor and primary are dissimilar, consider an alternative diagnoses (e.g., benign inclusions or metastases from other sites)Metastatic grades 1 and 2 lobular carcinomas can be very difficult to identify in nodes as they can mimic lymphocytes or histiocytesMetastases may be focalUsually present adjacent to peripheral subcapsular sinusRare metastases present in the center of the nodeSLNs may be sampled after neoadjuvant therapyIn some cases, a node sampled before treatment will be marked with a clip ± an additional localization device (e.g., a radioactive seed)In such cases, the surgeon should obtain a specimen radiograph to ensure the targeted lesion(s) have been excisedThe pathologist should document the presence of clips/localization devices on gross evaluationMetastases that have responded to treatment leave a fibrotic tumor bed in 2/3 of casesUseful to report presence of fibrosis consistent with tumor bed when presentHowever, in 1/3 of cases, a lymph node with a prior metastasis will look completely normalResponse to treatment can vary from node to nodeResidual metastatic carcinoma may be present as scattered foci over a tumor bed and be difficult to detect on frozen sectionCells may have markedly enlarged pleomorphic nuclei and abundant cytoplasm, suggesting that cells may not be viableViability cannot be determined with certainty based on morphologyAny residual tumor cells should be reported, as this may affect managementLymphomaCan present as axillary adenopathyWould be an unusual and unexpected finding in the axillary nodes of a woman with breast cancerWomen with known low-grade lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia may have nodal involvementCytologic preparations are helpful to reveal the morphology and dyscohesive nature of cellsIf sufficient tissue is available, tissue should be saved for ancillary studiesFrozen tissue (DNA analysis), flow cytometry, and fixatives for hematopathologyMelanomaTumor cells usually appear dyscohesive with markedly pleomorphic nucleiTumors that are pigmented grossly or microscopically are easy to identifyHowever, many metastatic melanomas do not exhibit obvious melanin productionPatients usually have a well-known history of melanomaIn rare cases, metastatic melanoma to the breast can be mistaken for primary breast carcinomaPatients with tattoos can have darkly pigmented nodes due to drainage of the pigment into lymphaticsThis pigment is often more granular than melanin, and nuclear atypia will not be presentSarcoidosisRarely involves axillary lymph nodesThe nodal tissue is replaced by confluent noncaseating granulomasThe node should be evaluated for possible infection by sending tissue for cultureBenign Epithelial InclusionsEctopic breast tissue, squamous cysts, or rarely, endosalpingiosis may be present as well-formed tubules within a nodeNormal breast epithelium may show apocrine or squamous metaplasiaBreast stroma may or may not be presentEndosalpingiosis consists of tubules lined by ciliated cellsBenign inclusions are very rare compared to metastatic well-differentiated breast carcinomaSiliconeCan seep out of implants (\"bleed\") or be released when an implant rupturedCan be transferred to regional lymph nodesSilicone granulomas can be very hard and gritty when cutGross appearance and texture can closely mimic metastatic carcinomaHistiocytes that have taken up silicone may resemble adipocytes or lipoblastsSilicone and metastatic carcinoma can be present in the same lymph nodeNevus Cell RestsCapsular nevus cell rests are small clusters of melanocytic cells present in ~ 5% of lymph nodesConsist of short spindle cells with bland nuclei with dispersed chromatin, sometimes associated with melaninUsually morphologically distinct from breast carcinomaGenerally present within the capsuleLess commonly involve septa and are present within the nodeImmunoperoxidase studies can confirm cells as nevus cells on permanent sectionsREPORTINGFrozen SectionSLNsThe total number of SLNs examined and the presence of any biopsy clips should be documentedFor postneoadjuvant breast cancer cases, failure to remove at least 3 SLNs or the biopsy-proven positive node (\"clipped node\") may lead to axillary dissectionThe size of metastatic deposits should be reportedThe presence of a micrometastasis or isolated tumor cells may not lead to immediate axillary dissectionExcision for lymphadenopathyA definite diagnosis is reported when possibleIn some cases, a provisional diagnosis is sufficient along with documentation of tissue sent for ancillary studies when appropriateCytologySLNsIf positive, and a gross metastasis is present, the size should be reportedIf positive, and a gross metastasis is not present, a frozen section to determine the size may be helpfulExcision for lymphadenopathyA provisional diagnosis is often appropriate with documentation of any tissue sent for ancillary studiesPITFALLSFalse-Negative DiagnosesFailure to examine entire nodeIf not all slices are frozen, macrometastases can be missed in ~ 30% of casesTissue

preparationsSingle cell infiltrative patternScattered throughout the node rather than predominantly in peripheral sinusesTumor cells can closely resemble normal cellsGrades 1 and 2 carcinomas can resemble lymphocytes or histiocytesGrade 3 carcinomas have nuclear pleomorphism and are generally easily recognizableSignet-ring cells with mucin vacuoles are helpful to recognize tumor cellsHowever, signet-ring cells are not always presentImmunoperoxidase studies for keratin on permanent sections is necessary in some cases for final diagnosisSmall or unusually located metastasesMetastases < 2 mm may not be present on frozen section or cytologic preparationShould not be considered discrepancy in quality assurance programs, as this is an intrinsic limitation of any technique that does not

          "URGICAL/CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS": "Goal of ConsultationPatients with breast cancerDetermine if metastatic carcinoma is present in the sentinel lymph node(s) (SLN)Metastases < 2 mm may or may not be detected but should be reported if identifiedPatients with axillary adenopathyDetermine cause of adenopathyChange in Patient ManagementIf metastasis is present in an SLN, completion axillary dissection may be performedIf no additional surgery is planned, there is no need for intraoperative evaluationIf lymphoma or infectious disease is detected, tissue is taken for ancillary studiesClinical SettingPatients with breast cancerLymph node evaluation is important for staging and prognosticationA negative SLN is highly predictive of a negative axillaClinical trials (e.g., ACOSOG Z0011) showed no significant survival benefit to completion axillary dissection in early-stage breast cancer patients with 1-2 positive SLNsAs a result, there has been a significant decline in frozen section evaluationIntraoperative SLN evaluation is still utilized in selected patients who would not fit Z0011 inclusion criteria, including those undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapyIn patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the detection of any disease in the SLN may lead to an axillary dissectionConservative management may be considered for low-volume disease (e.g., isolated tumor cells or micrometastasis)SLNs may be identified by injecting a blue dye, a radiolabeled solution (technetium-99), or bothPatients with axillary adenopathyAxillary lymph nodes may be enlarged due to reactive changes, infection, or malignancyAn excision of an axillary node may be performed for intraoperative diagnosisIn many cases, fine-needle aspiration or a core needle biopsy are used for this purpose",
          "SPECIMEN EVALUATION": "GrossAll nodes are bluntly dissected from the specimen and carefully countedThe number of nodes present and the number with metastases are used to determine the need for additional surgeryIf each node is inked a different color, slices from multiple nodes can be frozen in the same blockThis allows the number of nodes with metastases to be determinedAll fat is trimmed away from the nodesIf a gradient of blue dye is present, the metastasis is most likely at the blue-stained poleEach node is thinly sliced at 2-mm intervalsIf the node is grossly suspicious for lymphoma or granulomatous/infectious disease, preservation of nonfrozen tissue for ancillary studies is helpfulFlow cytometry, frozen tissue (molecular studies), and hematopathology fixatives are used for suspected lymphomaCultures are used for granulomatous/infectious diseaseSLNs identified using technetium-99 do not expose pathology personnel to dangerous levels of radiationSpecial protective equipment or disposal of tissue are not necessaryHowever, if a new or nonstandard technique is utilized, levels of radiation and the resulting risk should be assessedHandling procedures should be approved by the institutional radiation safety officeFrozen SectionIf a grossly evident metastasis is present, only 1 representative section need be frozenScrape or touch preparations can also be used to document an obvious metastasisIf the procedure is an SLN biopsy, all slices of all grossly normal nodes are frozenAt least 1 H&E slide, including a complete cross section of all slices, should be evaluatedIf the purpose is to establish a diagnosis to explain adenopathy, only 1 representative section should be frozenCytologic preparations should be used, when feasible, to preserve tissue for possible ancillary studiesCytologyEach cut surface is scraped with a curved scalpel blade or glass slide and smeared on another slideEach node should be separately evaluatedUseful when either infection or lymphoma is suspectedTouch imprints, rather than scrape preparations, may be more helpful for lymphomaAlternative Method to Frozen Section1-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) is a currently available assay to detect epithelial cels in nodes based on amplification of cytokeratin 19 mRNA (Sysmex Corporation)Assay uses a homogenized tissue lysate of entire nodeThe equipment and reagents are expensive and are only available from one companyUsed as an alternative to frozen section in some countriesBoth OSNA and conventional frozen section detect macrometastases in the majority of cases (> 97%)OSNA detects more micrometastases, but the clinical usefulness of finding small breast cancer metastases is limitedOSNA can only detect epithelial cells in lymph nodesCannot determine the likely origin of the metastatic carcinomaCannot detect rare cytokeratin 19 negative carcinomasCannot diagnosis diseases other than carcinoma (e.g. lymphoma, melanoma, infection)Contamination by nonmalignant epithelial cells is a concern",
          "MOST COMMON DIAGNOSES": "Metastatic Breast CarcinomaMost common carcinoma found in axillary nodes of womenMetastases from the lung (usually ipsilateral) or regional skin cancers are the next most likely primary sitesMetastatic tumor almost always resembles the primaryDuctal and lobular carcinoma are the most common typesPreoperative review of slides or reports can be very helpful for correlationIf a metastatic tumor and primary are dissimilar, consider an alternative diagnoses (e.g., benign inclusions or metastases from other sites)Metastatic grades 1 and 2 lobular carcinomas can be very difficult to identify in nodes as they can mimic lymphocytes or histiocytesMetastases may be focalUsually present adjacent to peripheral subcapsular sinusRare metastases present in the center of the nodeSLNs may be sampled after neoadjuvant therapyIn some cases, a node sampled before treatment will be marked with a clip ± an additional localization device (e.g., a radioactive seed)In such cases, the surgeon should obtain a specimen radiograph to ensure the targeted lesion(s) have been excisedThe pathologist should document the presence of clips/localization devices on gross evaluationMetastases that have responded to treatment leave a fibrotic tumor bed in 2/3 of casesUseful to report presence of fibrosis consistent with tumor bed when presentHowever, in 1/3 of cases, a lymph node with a prior metastasis will look completely normalResponse to treatment can vary from node to nodeResidual metastatic carcinoma may be present as scattered foci over a tumor bed and be difficult to detect on frozen sectionCells may have markedly enlarged pleomorphic nuclei and abundant cytoplasm, suggesting that cells may not be viableViability cannot be determined with certainty based on morphologyAny residual tumor cells should be reported, as this may affect managementLymphomaCan present as axillary adenopathyWould be an unusual and unexpected finding in the axillary nodes of a woman with breast cancerWomen with known low-grade lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia may have nodal involvementCytologic preparations are helpful to reveal the morphology and dyscohesive nature of cellsIf sufficient tissue is available, tissue should be saved for ancillary studiesFrozen tissue (DNA analysis), flow cytometry, and fixatives for hematopathologyMelanomaTumor cells usually appear dyscohesive with markedly pleomorphic nucleiTumors that are pigmented grossly or microscopically are easy to identifyHowever, many metastatic melanomas do not exhibit obvious melanin productionPatients usually have a well-known history of melanomaIn rare cases, metastatic melanoma to the breast can be mistaken for primary breast carcinomaPatients with tattoos can have darkly pigmented nodes due to drainage of the pigment into lymphaticsThis pigment is often more granular than melanin, and nuclear atypia will not be presentSarcoidosisRarely involves axillary lymph nodesThe nodal tissue is replaced by confluent noncaseating granulomasThe node should be evaluated for possible infection by sending tissue for cultureBenign Epithelial InclusionsEctopic breast tissue, squamous cysts, or rarely, endosalpingiosis may be present as well-formed tubules within a nodeNormal breast epithelium may show apocrine or squamous metaplasiaBreast stroma may or may not be presentEndosalpingiosis consists of tubules lined by ciliated cellsBenign inclusions are very rare compared to metastatic well-differentiated breast carcinomaSiliconeCan seep out of implants (\"bleed\") or be released when an implant rupturedCan be transferred to regional lymph nodesSilicone granulomas can be very hard and gritty when cutGross appearance and texture can closely mimic metastatic carcinomaHistiocytes that have taken up silicone may resemble adipocytes or lipoblastsSilicone and metastatic carcinoma can be present in the same lymph nodeNevus Cell RestsCapsular nevus cell rests are small clusters of melanocytic cells present in ~ 5% of lymph nodesConsist of short spindle cells with bland nuclei with dispersed chromatin, sometimes associated with melaninUsually morphologically distinct from breast carcinomaGenerally present within the capsuleLess commonly involve septa and are present within the nodeImmunoperoxidase studies can confirm cells as nevus cells on permanent sectionsREPORTINGFrozen SectionSLNsThe total number of SLNs examined and the presence of any biopsy clips should be documentedFor postneoadjuvant breast cancer cases, failure to remove at least 3 SLNs or the biopsy-proven positive node (\"clipped node\") may lead to axillary dissectionThe size of metastatic deposits should be reportedThe presence of a micrometastasis or isolated tumor cells may not lead to immediate axillary dissectionExcision for lymphadenopathyA definite diagnosis is reported when possibleIn some cases, a provisional diagnosis is sufficient along with documentation of tissue sent for ancillary studies when appropriateCytologySLNsIf positive, and a gross metastasis is present, the size should be reportedIf positive, and a gross metastasis is not present, a frozen section to determine the size may be helpfulExcision for lymphadenopathyA provisional diagnosis is often appropriate with documentation of any tissue sent for ancillary studiesPITFALLSFalse-Negative DiagnosesFailure to examine entire nodeIf not all slices are frozen, macrometastases can be missed in ~ 30% of casesTissue should never be taken from nodes in a way that would interfere with detecting all macrometastasesMetastatic lobular carcinomaCan be very difficult to detect in frozen sections or cytologic preparationsSingle cell infiltrative patternScattered throughout the node rather than predominantly in peripheral sinusesTumor cells can closely resemble normal cellsGrades 1 and 2 carcinomas can resemble lymphocytes or histiocytesGrade 3 carcinomas have nuclear pleomorphism and are generally easily recognizableSignet-ring cells with mucin vacuoles are helpful to recognize tumor cellsHowever, signet-ring cells are not always presentImmunoperoxidase studies for keratin on permanent sections is necessary in some cases for final diagnosisSmall or unusually located metastasesMetastases < 2 mm may not be present on frozen section or cytologic

varying sizesGerminal centers have reactive featuresGerminal center polarization (dark and light zones)Multiple cell types present within germinal centers (centrocytes, centroblasts, tingible body macrophages)Germinal centers typically bulge out, creating lobulated outer surface to nodeLymphoproliferative disorders typically expand node, resulting in rounded shapeMixed population in interfollicular areas (small lymphocytes, plasma cells, histiocytes)Normal capsule without thickening and with open sinusesNon-Hodgkin LymphomaPatients are typically older (median age at diagnosis: 66

diagnosis is not necessary intraoperativelyLarge cell lymphomas are often easily recognized as malignantOften show dyscohesive growth patternMetastatic melanoma and signet-ring cell carcinoma (including lobular breast cancer) also consist of dyscohesive cellsPatients will often have clinical history of malignancyIn other cases, primary carcinoma is clinically occult, and 1st diagnosis is of metastatic diseaseSheets of large, atypical cells, often with frequent mitosesLymphomas of mediastinum and retroperitoneum can be associated with dense fibrosisCan resemble carcinomas with desmoplasia or fibrosing diseasesFlow cytometry is often low yield for lesions with dense fibrosisConsider lymphoblastic lymphoma in young patient with mediastinal massCytologic preparations are often

nodulesInterfollicular expansion between normal germinal centers is suspiciousCytology preparations may only reveal background of normal lymphocytesDiagnostic Reed-Sternberg cells may be rare and difficult to identifyIf Hodgkin lymphoma is strongly suspected and tissue is limited, tissue for flow cytometry, which will characterize the background inflammatory infiltrate, is of low priorityAcute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/LymphomaNeoplasm of precursor cells (lymphoblasts) that most commonly occurs in children but can be seen at any ageT-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL/LBL) is most common in adolescent male patients and often presents with large mediastinal mass; lymph nodes and extranodal sites may also be involvedB-cell ALL/LBL is most common in children < 6 years old and less frequently involves mediastinum; however, extramedullary involvement is common, particularly in CNS, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, testes, skin, soft tissue, and boneSpecific diagnosis is helpful during IOC, if possible, as mediastinal masses can show rapid growth, resulting in respiratory emergencyLymphoblasts in B-cell ALL/LBL and T-cell ALL/LBL are morphologically indistinguishableBlast morphology can vary from small cells with condensed chromatin, indistinct nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm to medium-sized cells with finely dispersed chromatin, variably prominent nucleoli, and moderate amounts of occasionally vacuolated cytoplasmNuclear contours may be round to irregular to convolutedCytologic preparations are often helpful in examining blast morphology, especially chromatin texture and presence of nucleoliTissue sections can provide helpful information in addition to cytologic appearance of cellsBlasts often show single-file infiltration of soft tissuesFrequent tingible body macrophages may give starry-sky appearanceMitotic figures are often numerousDepending on blast morphology, it may be difficult to distinguish ALL/LBL from mature or high-grade lymphomaClinical scenario and site of involvement are often helpful in suggesting ALL/LBL, and immunophenotyping may be necessary to confirm diagnosisAllocate tissue for flow cytometry and cytogenetic studiesIf tissue is limited, many cytogenetic lesions can be identified by FISH analysis on paraffin-embedded tissueMetastatic CancerPatients are usually older (> 60 years)Important to know any history of prior

EVALUATIONGrossThe number of nodes is identified and recordedThe number of involved and uninvolved nodes is often important for staging and prognosisEach node must be identifiable for an accurate countEach nodes can be inked a unique color or each node can be submitted in a separate cassetteThe nodes are thinly sectioned (~ 0.2 cm)Metastatic carcinoma usually focally involves a node as a firm,

has a uniform fleshy or nodular appearanceInfection may cause a mottled appearance with necrosisFrozen SectionA representative section of the most suspicious area can be frozen if a lymph node appears grossly positiveIf negative, the remainder of the lymph should be frozenIf the gross appearance is suggestive of lymphoma or infection, cytologic preparations (smears) are preferableCytologyScrape or touch preparations are often diagnosticFor potential lymphoproliferative disorders, cytology smears provide superior nuclear detail and preserve fresh tissue for ancillary studiesPossible infectious

lymphomaB-Plus, othersFlow cytometry: Suspected non-Hodgkin lymphomaCytogenetics for karyotype: Suspected lymphoma or sarcoma (fresh viable tissue)MOST COMMON DIAGNOSESMetastatic CarcinomaUp to 90% of cervical lymph node metastases are from head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs)At least 10% of patients who present with nodal metastasis have an unknown primaryThe primary tumor remains unidentified in subset of casesSCCConventional SCCs are typically keratinizingFrequently from mucosal or cutaneous sitesOccult primaries are often HPV-associated oropharyngeal primariesCharacteristically cysticNonkeratinizing morphology, but focal keratinization is commonMay have undifferentiated morphology identical to Epstein-Barr virus-associated nasopharyngeal carcinomaMost commonly involve level II and III nodesNasopharyngeal carcinomaNonkeratinizing, differentiated, or undifferentiated SCCUndifferentiated pattern has syncytial clusters or individual cells with large nuclei that have vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoliEpstein-Barr virus present in essentially all casesMay involve posterior triangle (level V) nodesLevel V involvement is unusual for other head and neck primariesPapillary thyroid carcinomaPapillary architecture, sometimes follicularEnlarged nuclei have irregular nuclear membranes, grooves, clearing, pale chromatin, delicate nucleoli, and pseudoinclusionsPsammoma bodies may be presentIf only psammoma bodies are seen, levels should be performed to identify carcinomaAdenocarcinomaConsider lung and gastrointestinal tract primariesPrimary head and neck adenocarcinomas are rareLeft-sided supraclavicular metastasis (Virchow node) often arises from abdomen or pelvisNeuroendocrine neoplasmsNeuroendocrine tumors from lung and medullary thyroid carcinoma may first present in cervical nodesMerkel cell carcinoma may present as metastasis or by local extension from skinMetastatic breast and prostate carcinoma can often have neuroendocrine appearanceMust be distinguished from similar-appearing tumors, including paraganglioma and parathyroid glandClinical correlation usually needed to identify primary sitePrudent to defer to permanent sections for classification in absence of known primaryMay require immunohistochemistry for definitive diagnosisMetastatic Malignant MelanomaMay show spindled or epithelioid morphology and often have nested growthMelanin pigment is helpful, but many tumors are amelanoticSarcoidosisTightly formed, often confluent, nonnecrotizing granulomataDiagnosis requires exclusion of infectious diseaseCultures should be sent intraoperatively when identified on frozen sectionLymphomaNon-Hodgkin lymphomaNormal nodal architecture is often effaced with a monotonous population of lymphoid cellsSmall lymphocytes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphomaLarge cells in large cell lymphomaFollicular lymphoma has a prominent nodular architecture mimicking germinal centers but formed by a uniform population of lymphocytesTrue germinal centers are populated by a polymorphous population of benign cellsThe differential diagnosis includes sarcomas (e.g., alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma) and metastases (e.g., olfactory neuroblastoma)Hodgkin lymphomaSclerosis and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate, including eosinophils, are clues to search for characteristic Reed-Sternberg cellsReactive ChangesProminent reactive germinal centers are formed by a polymorphous lymphoid populationTingible-body macrophages are presentIf the clinical suspicion for lymphoma is high, tissue should be allocated for ancillary studiesREPORTINGFrozen SectionReport the presence or absence of metastasis; if possible, report tumor typeExtranodal extension is associated with a worse outcome for many tumors and should be noted if presentReport the presence of granulomatous inflammation and whether or not it is necrotizingIf lymphoma suspected, it is sufficient to report as \"atypical lymphoid infiltrate\" and defer classificationPITFALLSNodular Hashimoto Thyroiditis vs. Metastatic Thyroid CarcinomaInflammation may result in parasitic thyroid nodules that appear to be lymph nodes to the surgeonHelpful to know if the nodule is adjacent to the thyroidThe epithelium consists of follicular cells with oncocytic change embedded in a lymphoid infiltrate with reactive germinal centers and variable fibrosisCells lack nuclear features of papillary thyroid carcinomaTrue nodal architecture is not present (e.g., a capsule with a peripheral sinus)Benign Developmental Cysts vs. Metastatic Squamous Cell CarcinomaThyroglossal duct (midline) and branchial cleft (lateral) cysts may mimic enlarged nodes clinicallyThe epithelial lining can be squamous or respiratory typeSquamous epithelial-lined cysts must be distinguished from cystic metastatic SCCMetastatic SCC is more likely in adultsOvertly malignant cytologic features are helpful to identify SCCDo not diagnose carcinoma in branchial cleft cyst, as this has not been convincingly shown to occurLymphoid Response to Salivary Tumor vs. Metastatic CarcinomaSalivary gland tumors with a prominent lymphoid response may be difficult to distinguish from nodal metastasisEspecially common in mucoepidermoid carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma, and Warthin tumorA capsule and subcapsular sinus help identify true lymph nodesThymic Tissue vs. Metastatic Squamous Cell CarcinomaThymic remnants may mimic nodes, and Hassall corpuscles may be mistaken for metastatic SCCThe thymus lacks the capsular structure with the medullary sinus and reactive germinal centers of a nodeHassall corpuscles have characteristic squamous whorls with keratohyaline granules and lack cytologic atypiaBenign InclusionsBenign salivary structures within intra- or periparotid lymph nodes as well as nevus cell rests can occurThey lack morphologic features of malignancy and are often not in the subcapsular sinus location typical for metastasisThe significance of incidental thyroid epithelium in a lymph node is controversial, but this finding may be assumed to represent a metastasisThe thyroid should be evaluated for a possible occult primary",

difficult to distinguish from other mesenchymal neoplasms by morphologyMaximal safe excision will typically be performed for meningioma and most other solid tumorsHematopoietic and inflammatory processes may mimic meningioma radiographically but do not require excisionIntraoperative histologic grading of meningiomas is unreliable; however, the presence of high-grade features may be included in the intraoperative diagnosisMay be indication for more aggressive resectionMolecular markers of anaplastic meningioma have been identified, which are not recognizable morphologicallyArchitecture varies with subtypeIt is generally unnecessary to distinguish other, typically lower grade architectural subtypes intraoperativelyGrade 2 and grade 3 architectural subtypes (chordoid or clear for grade 2, and papillary or rhabdoid for grade 3) must be the predominant architecture across the entire specimen to impact gradingUsing them as grading criteria intraoperatively may be subject to

metastasis to ovary is suspected and there is no prior history of carcinoma, peritoneal cavity is inspected for possible primary sitesAppendix is possible site and may be resectedClinical SettingIt is difficult to determine if an ovarian mass is benign or malignant preoperativelyImaging findings are often nonspecificNeedle biopsy is contraindicated due to the risk of spillage of malignant cells into the peritoneal cavityMalignancy is more common in women > 40 years of ageOvarian lesions in women < 40 years of age are generally benignPreservation of fertility is frequent goal in young womenSPECIMEN EVALUATIONGrossGreat care should be used in examining the outer surface of the ovary as involvement may alter stageSurface must not be rubbed or abradedAny irregularities to the surface are notedMay be due to carcinoma penetrating capsule or to serosal metastasisSelectively ink surface, including any possible excrescences or metastasisThe ovary is serially sectionedCysts with fluid under pressure can appear to be solid masses by palpationThese cysts should be opened with caution and with proper eye protection to avoid uncontrolled release of contentsSmall incision directed away from the prosector is made into the cystAdequate surgical drapes, a pan, or sink should be available to dispose of cyst fluidIf multilocular, all cysts should be openedEvaluate appearance of solid masses and cystsInner surface of cysts must not be touched as this may dislodge diagnostic cellsBilateral involvement or multiple nodules within a single ovary may be seen in metastatic diseaseIt is noted whether contents are serous (freely flowing) or mucinous (viscous and sticky)Unilocular cyst with smooth inner liningAlmost always benignTypical diagnoses are cystadenoma, follicle cyst, or

incorporated preexisting ovarian structuresREPORTINGFrozen SectionCarcinomaIn cases of carcinoma where the subtype (serous, mucinous, or endometrioid) is obvious, a specific diagnosis is appropriateExample: \"Serous carcinoma, high grade, involving ovarian surface\"Cases with ambiguous histologic features may be reported as \"carcinoma\" with a note describing the tumor grade (low vs. high) and possible subtypeExample: \"Adenocarcinoma, low grade, favor endometrioid\"If the lesion is a possible metastasis, this should be reportedExample: \"Adenocarcinoma with extensive necrosis, colorectal metastasis cannot be ruled out\"If definitive diagnosis of carcinoma is uncertain, it is best to defer to permanent sectionsPatient can undergo definitive surgery in 2nd procedure if carcinoma is confirmedBorderline tumorsUse of the phrase \"at least\" is appropriate to convey the heterogeneous nature of these tumorsUp to 1/4 of cases will show areas of carcinoma after more extensive sampling on permanent sectionsExample: \"At least serous borderline tumor; ovarian surface negative in 2 examined sections\"Number of sections examined should be communicated to surgeonSpindle cell tumorsFibromas and leiomyomas may appear similar on frozen sectionClarification of the site of origin may be helpful as fibroma would be favored by ovarian originOtherwise, a diagnosis of \"benign spindle cell neoplasm\" is appropriateCellular fibromas and spindled granulosa cell tumors may be indistinguishable on frozen sectionExample: \"Cellular spindle cell neoplasm, the differential diagnosis includes cellular fibroma vs. granulosa cell tumor\"Presence of marked cellularity, atypia, and necrosis may indicate malignant sarcomaPITFALLSAdequate Sampling of Large Tumors (> 10 cm)It may be difficult to exclude malignancy in very large ovarian massesMucinous NeoplasmsMucinous carcinomas can be very heterogeneous in appearance and can require extensive sampling for diagnosisMetastasis from gastrointestinal primary may mimic ovarian mucinous tumorBorderline TumorsUp to 1/4 of tumors classified as borderline on frozen section will be reclassified as malignant

groovesJuvenile granulosa cell tumor\nSex cord tumor, most common in first 3 decades of lifePrimitive-appearing granulosa cells growing in follicular and solid patternsNeoplastic cells have abundant pale cytoplasm, round nuclei that lack grooves, and brisk mitotic activitySertoli-Leydig Cell TumorWide age range (mean age: 25 years)Androgenic manifestations develop in 40-60% of patientsWell-differentiated tumors consist of Sertoli tubules admixed with clusters of Leydig cellsModerately differentiated tumors consist of a lobular pattern of atypical Sertoli cells growing in sheets, tubules, or cords, admixed with clusters of Leydig cellsPoorly differentiated tumors have a sarcomatoid appearance with focal corded or tubular growth and rare clusters of Leydig cellsHeterologous elements (e.g., mucinous epithelium, carcinoid, skeletal muscle, cartilage) are present in 20% of casesModerately and poorly differentiated tumors are malignant in 10% and 60% of cases, respectivelySteroid Cell Tumor, Not Otherwise SpecifiedPatients often present with androgenic (50%) or estrogenic (10%) manifestationsTumor is composed of large polygonal cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and round nuclei with prominent nucleoliFactors predicting malignancy include size > 7 cm, significant nuclear atypia and mitotic activity, necrosis, and hemorrhageLeydig cell

drainage due to chronic/intermittent torsionEnlarged ovary with edematous stroma, luteinized stromal cells, and incorporated preexisting ovarian structuresREPORTINGFrozen SectionCarcinomaIn cases of carcinoma where the subtype (serous, mucinous, or endometrioid) is obvious, a specific diagnosis is appropriateExample: \"Serous carcinoma, high grade, involving ovarian surface\"Cases with ambiguous histologic features may be reported as \"carcinoma\" with a note describing the tumor grade (low vs. high) and possible subtypeExample: \"Adenocarcinoma, low grade, favor endometrioid\"If the lesion is a possible metastasis, this should be reportedExample: \"Adenocarcinoma with extensive necrosis, colorectal metastasis cannot be ruled out\"If definitive diagnosis of carcinoma is uncertain, it is best to defer to permanent sectionsPatient can undergo definitive surgery in 2nd procedure if carcinoma is confirmedBorderline tumorsUse of the phrase \"at least\" is appropriate to convey the heterogeneous nature of these tumorsUp to 1/4 of cases will show areas of carcinoma after more extensive sampling on permanent sectionsExample: \"At least serous borderline tumor; ovarian surface negative in 2 examined sections\"Number of sections examined should be communicated to surgeonSpindle cell tumorsFibromas and leiomyomas may appear similar on frozen sectionClarification of the site of origin may be helpful as fibroma would be favored by ovarian originOtherwise, a diagnosis of \"benign spindle cell neoplasm\" is appropriateCellular fibromas and spindled granulosa cell tumors may be indistinguishable on frozen sectionExample: \"Cellular spindle cell neoplasm, the differential diagnosis includes cellular fibroma vs. granulosa cell tumor\"Presence of marked cellularity, atypia, and necrosis may indicate malignant sarcomaPITFALLSAdequate Sampling of Large Tumors (> 10 cm)It may be difficult to exclude malignancy in very large ovarian massesMucinous NeoplasmsMucinous carcinomas can be very heterogeneous in appearance and can require extensive sampling for diagnosisMetastasis from gastrointestinal primary may mimic ovarian mucinous tumorBorderline TumorsUp to 1/4 of tumors classified as borderline on frozen section will be reclassified as malignant after extensive sampling"

diagnosis of carcinoma should be made, when possibleIf definite features are not seen, a diagnosis of \"atypical glands\" may be more appropriateIn the absence of definite carcinoma, other tumors can be given a provisional diagnosisThe type of tumor generally does not alter the surgical approachPancreatic parenchymal marginInvasive carcinoma should be reported if present at the marginIf the margin shows normal pancreatic tissue, report \"normal parenchyma; negative for PanIN and carcinoma\"If low- or moderate-grade lesion is present in a duct at the margin, report \"negative for carcinoma; focal PanIN1-2 present, involving main/side branch pancreatic ducts\"If a high-grade lesion present in a duct at the margin, report \"negative for carcinoma; PanIN-3 present, involving main/side branch pancreatic ducts\"If no epithelium is present in the main duct at the margin, report \"denuded main duct epithelium, unable to evaluate PanIN\"Bile duct marginReport as positive or negative for invasive carcinomaReliabilityFalse-positive diagnoses of primary lesions are rare, as pathologists tend to be very conservative in making a diagnosis of a carcinoma with a very poor prognosisHowever, false-negative diagnoses are more common with a negative predictive value of ~ 50%Accuracy for evaluation of margins is much higher (> 95%)PITFALLSChronic Pancreatitis vs.\nCarcinomaPancreatic carcinoma is a difficult diagnosis to make on frozen sectionBoth pancreatitis and carcinoma can consist of small tubules in fibrotic stromaFeatures favoring malignancy includeDisorganized distribution of ductsDucts present in interlobular stroma or adjacent to thick-walled arteries/veinsDucts in peripancreatic soft tissuePerineural invasionBile Duct Accessory Glands vs.\nCarcinomaThe bile duct has numerous peribiliary glandsMay be difficult to distinguish from well-differentiated adenocarcinomasClustered in a lobular pattern in the wall of the ductNuclear pleomorphism and mitoses should not be presentShould not be located near large blood vesselsReactive Changes in Bile DuctA stent may be placed in the bile duct in patients with obstructionInflammation can cause reactive changesThe following resulting changes may be difficult to distinguish from neoplasiaPapillary architectureCytologic atypia (enlarged nuclei with nucleoli)Pyloric gland metaplasiaUlcerationInvasive Carcinoma in Bile DuctCarcinoma is usually present in deeper tissue, located away from the duct luminaThe entire wall must be examined for carcinomaNerves should be carefully examined for perineural

been removedChange in Patient ManagementAfter removal of targeted parathyroid gland(s) or biopsy of a gland is confirmed, additional surgery is not necessaryIntraoperative differentiation of adenoma, multinodular disease, primary hyperplasia, from normal parathyroid glands may be used to guide surgeryIn rare cases, confirmation of a parathyroid carcinoma can guide completion of surgeryClinical SettingHyperparathyroidismThe morphologic correlates of the different types of hyperparathyroidism include parathyroid hyperplasia, parathyroid adenoma, and carcinomaThe precise diagnosis of parathyroid disorders depends on clinical features, laboratory results, genetic findings, and detailed morphologic assessmentPrimary hyperparathyroidismDefined as disease due to abnormal parathyroid gland functionPatients are usually diagnosed with hypercalcemia on serum tests and found to have elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH)Less commonly, patients present with symptoms of osteoporosis or renal calculi~ 80% have solitary adenoma~ 10% have 2 adenomas~ 10% have involvement of 3 or 4 glandsThis is considered primary hyperplasia and may be associated with lithium use, radiation exposure, or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromesSecondary hyperparathyroidismDefined as an increase in normal gland function in response to another disease stateParathyroid glands become enlarged and hyperfunctioning in response to low calcium levelsMost commonly due to renal failureCauses debilitating loss of calcium from bonesTertiary hyperparathyroidismAfter secondary hyperplasia, glands can start to function autonomouslySerum calcium becomes elevatedMEN syndromesHyperparathyroidism is almost always due to multiglandular/multinodular adenomasNot considered parathyroid hyperplasiaSurgery for thyroid resection or neck explorationParathyroid glands may be resected inadvertentlySurgical ApproachesPreoperative imagingParathyroid glands can be difficult for surgeon to identifyNormal glands are very smallNumber and location of glands can varyMost people have 4 parathyroid glands, 10% have ≥ 5, and 3% have < 415% are found in unusual locations: Mediastinum, within thyroid, thymus, and other sitesLymph nodes, thymic tissue, thyroid nodules, and other areas of nodular tissue may resemble glands grosslyThe number and location of abnormally enlarged glands can usually be identified by preoperative imagingUltrasound: Most commonAlso used to evaluate thyroid for abnormalities prior to surgerySestamibi scanTc-99m is taken up by hyperfunctioning glandsUseful to identify adenomas in unusual locationsLess useful to detect multiple hyperplastic glands4D CTMinimally invasive surgery may be used when the location of abnormal gland or glands is knownSurgery for adenoma with intraoperative PTH (IOPTH) assaySerum PTH is evaluated during surgeryPTH has a half-life of < 5 minutesDecreased PTH occurs within 10-15 minutes after removal of hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissueIf PTH decreases by > 50% after removal of an adenoma, further surgery is not necessaryFrozen section is not necessary for confirmation of parathyroid tissueIf PTH is not decreased, surgeon will search for 2nd adenomaIOPTH assays have largely replaced frozen section when availableIOPTH on a fine-needle biopsy of excised tissue can be used to document it is parathyroid tissueTissue aspirate is rinsed

unexpected malignancy is identifiedOrgan transplant or organ harvesting for transplant may be canceledAdditional biopsies may be taken to identify the primary siteFor patients with known malignancy, surgery may also be alteredThe presence of metastatic disease may change the type of planned surgery (e.g., palliative instead of curative)For women with ovarian lesions, the peritoneum or omentum may be biopsied to determine if an invasive implant is presentIf found, the surgeon may choose to place a port for chemotherapyClinical SettingDuring abdominal surgery for benign or malignant conditions, the surgeon routinely explores the abdominal cavityIt is important to determine if any masses found are benign or malignant to guide subsequent surgerySPECIMEN EVALUATIONGrossMasses are generally completely removed as small excisional biopsiesIn a patient with an ovarian mass, omentum may be removed and sent for intraoperative consultation to assess for the presence and types of implantsIn general, the specimen does not need to be inked, as primary isolated malignancies of the peritoneum are exceedingly rareThe tissue is serially sectioned and lesions identifiedThe size, number, color, and borders of lesions are recordedFrozen SectionSmall biopsies are completely frozenIn large samples, areas of fleshy tumor growth should be preferentially sampledAreas of extensive necrosis or mucin should be avoided as they are often nondiagnosticDiffusely infiltrative carcinomas in the omentum may be slightly paler and firmer than normal adipose tissueFrozen section evaluation of grossly normal tissue is of low yield and generally contraindicatedMOST COMMON DIAGNOSESMetastatic Carcinoma (Nonovarian)If the patient has a history of malignancy or current malignancy, it is important to be aware of the histologic type and whether or not the patient has been treatedTreated carcinomas can be difficult to detect due to sparse tumor cells, inflammation, and fibrosisTumors of the gastrointestinal tract often metastasize to the peritoneum and have a variety of histologic presentationsColon carcinoma is typically composed of glands with varying degrees of cystic dilationTall columnar tumor cells line the glandsExtensive central \"dirty\" necrosis is commonPancreatic carcinomas are often metastatic at time of surgeryThe neoplastic glands are generally smaller than those of colon carcinoma, lined by cuboidal cells, and lack \"dirty\" necrosisThe presence of mucinous glands, desmoplasia, and perineural invasion are often helpful features in identifying this tumorSurgery for curative intent is often aborted if metastatic disease is identifiedSignet-ring cell gastric carcinoma may metastasize widelySmall tumor cells with little cytoplasmic mucin may resemble histiocytes, lymphocytes, or reactive mesothelial cells and be difficult to identifyEnlarged cells with abundant mucin vacuoles that displace nuclei are easier to identifyLobular carcinoma of breast may have a similar appearance and can present as an occult primary siteThe signet-ring cells of lobular carcinoma tend to have a distinct central mucin droplet in a vacuoleThe signet-ring cells of gastric carcinoma tend to have multiple small cytoplasmic vacuolesThese carcinomas are typically not associated with desmoplastic responseInfiltrated adipose tissue may be slightly paler and firmer than normal tissuePseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a clinical syndrome caused by mucinous ascites and implants in the abdominal cavityPMP is most often secondary to a carcinoma of the appendix but can also be associated with colon, ovary, urachus, and pancreas primariesThe specimen is primarily composed of mucinOnly scant foci of mucinous epithelium may be present and may not be seen on frozen sectionNeuroendocrine tumors are typically composed of nests, cords, or trabeculae of tumor cells, which display vesicular (i.e., salt and pepper) chromatinCancers from nonabdominal sites also metastasize to abdomen but are less commonOvarian CarcinomaIn women with ovarian masses, serous tumors (borderline, low grade, and high grade) are most likely to be associated with metastasesHigh-grade carcinomas frequently display striking nuclear atypia, increased mitotic activity, and widespread disseminationLow-grade carcinomas often show destructive invasion of underlying structures but are cytologically bland compared to their high-grade counterpartsWomen with tumors of low malignant potential (borderline tumors) may have extraovarian implants at time of surgeryThe type of implant is an important prognostic factorNoninvasive implant (borderline tumor)Desmoplastic: Associated with marked stromal reactionForm smoothly contoured foci of glands surrounded by fibrous stromaPapillae and glandular structures often presentEpithelial: Not associated with marked stromal reactionCircumscribed clusters of glandsMay have branching papillae and detached cell clustersInvasive implant (low-grade serous carcinoma)Shows definite, irregular, destructive invasion with desmoplasia into normal underlying tissue structures\"Invasive implant\" is no longer accepted

SettingPatients with pituitary tumors usually present with symptoms due to abnormal function, compression of adjacent structures, or bothOverproduction of hormonesAdrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH): Causes adrenal glands to make cortisol (Cushing syndrome)Fat accumulation and upper back humpHypertensionThin skin and striaeHyperglycemiaAnxiety, irritability, or depressionGrowth hormone (GH)Gigantism: Accelerated and excessive growth in children and adolescentsAcromegaly: Coarsened facial features and enlarged hands and feet in adultsHyperglycemiaProlactin (PRL)Can be caused by adenoma or any lesion obstructing pituitary stalk (blood flow normally resulting in inhibition is diminished)Decrease in sex hormonesWomen: Galactorrhea, irregular or absent menstrual periodsMen: Loss

        "raw_text": "INTRODUCTIONPurposeTissues must be hardened in order to cut thin sections less than the thickness of 1 cell for microscopic evaluationThe procedure of paraffin embedding used for permanent sections requires many hoursFreezing tissue is a rapid method that can be used to harden tissue sufficiently to allow thin sectioningSlides can be prepared for pathologic diagnosis within a short period of timeA limitation to performing intraoperative consultations quickly is the time required for tissue to freezePriority should be given to the gross evaluation of the specimen and selection of tissue for freezingThe sooner tissue starts freezing, the more quickly slides can be available for diagnosisLess urgent tasks can be performed while tissue is freezing (e.g., writing a detailed gross description or labeling slides)Frozen Section and Cytologic PreparationsComparisonEach method has advantages and disadvantagesMethods provide complementary informationIn many cases, use of both methods is more accurate than either technique aloneMETHODSelection of TissueGood gross examination is required in order to select tissue most likely to yield the most helpful diagnosisOrientation should be maintained when importantSkin sections should be cut perpendicular to the epidermal surfaceColon sections should be perpendicular to the mucosal surfaceA tissue section should be ≤ 8 mm x ≤ 8 mm x 1-2 mm (thick) in size to freeze wellIf more tissue needs to be frozen, the section should be divided into multiple blocksIf moist, tissue should be gently blotted dryMinimizes freezing artifactHowever, do not use gauze or place tissue on gauze as this can introduce artifactual holes in tissueFreezing permanently changes tissueThe morphologic appearance of once frozen tissue is not the same as tissue that has never been frozenAs water freezes, ice crystals form in tissueLarger crystals form with time; tissue should be frozen as quickly as possible to minimize crystal sizeIce crystals disrupt cellular structures, and these changes are not completely reversed with thawingThe chromatin pattern of nuclei is often indistinctNuclei can appear hyperchromatic compared to tissue that has not been frozenAntigens can be altered by freezing, and this can change immunoreactivity patternsPreviously frozen tissue should be avoided for additional studiesIf used, results should be interpreted with cautionHistochemical stains can be altered on previously frozen tissueSmall primary tumors/lesions should never be completely frozen for these reasonsType of TissueAny tissue that can be cut with a scalpel can be cut by a microtome for frozen sectionBone and other heavily calcified lesions cannot be cutScrape preparations from bone may be used to evaluate marrow marginsHeavily calcified lesions are generally benign and need not be evaluated by frozen section intraoperativelye.g., an infarcted epiploic appendage often calcifiesAdipose tissue requires colder temperatures and is difficult to cutIf not important for diagnosis, fatty tissue should be dissected away from important areas of the specimene.g., lymph nodes should be dissected away from surrounding adipose tissueTissue fixed in formalin does not adhere well to slidesIf only immersed in formalin for a short time and of sufficient size, it may be possible to cut a central section that has not yet been exposed to formalinIf it is necessary to examine fixed tissue, special coated slides must be usedSlides must be handled very gently during staining to avoid tissue lossTissue with suspected or known infectious disease should not be frozen unless absolutely necessary for patient managementHigh-risk infectious diseases for pathology personnel are HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and tuberculosisCytologic preparations should be used when possibleIf a frozen section is prepared, the cryostat should be marked as contaminated and decontaminated after useTerminologyChuck: Metal platform used for holding embedding medium and tissue for sectioningBase: Embedding medium placed and frozen on chuck to cushion and protect tissueBlock: Tissue frozen on base and covered by additional embedding mediumPreparation of BlockThere are multiple methods of preparing a base of embedding medium according to the specific cryostat and equipment usedEmbedding medium is a liquid mixture that solidifies when frozen at appropriate temperature for cutting sectionsMay contain polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, resins, and other substancesA variety of commercial products are availableDensity is similar to tissue when frozenContainer must be kept capped when not in useAlcohol can evaporate and adversely alter the quality of the compoundIf the specimen is very small, a base can be precut and faced on the cryostat to minimize the amount of tissue lost to level blockTissue can be transferred to the frozen base by touching the base to the tissueOrientation can be important for margin sectionsPerpendicular margin sections should be placed such that the inked margin is clearly visible at 1 edgeOrientation of en face margins should be recordedSlides are labeled to indicate the 1st and subsequent deeper levelsIf the true margin is the superficial aspect of the tissue, the 1st frozen section slide is the true marginIf the true margin is embedded face down, the 1st frozen section is not the true marginIf positive, deeper levels can be obtained that are closer to the true marginMultiple fragments should be grouped closely but not overlappedTissue should not extend beyond the edge of the chuckThin sections can be rolled and embedded in cross sectionCyst wallSkin for evaluation of toxic epidermal necrolysis vs. staphylococcal scalded skin syndromeFreezing TissueEmbedding medium is applied to completely cover the tissue sitting on the baseShould not extend beyond chuckIf medium extends to back or stem of chuck, it must be removed or it will interfere in attaching the chuck to the cryostatEmbedding medium can be kept cool in refrigerator to speed freezing processShould form a rim around tissue to aid in holding tissue and tethering the section to chuck when cuttingThe block is placed in the cryostat to freezeSome cryostats have rapid freezing cyclesAlternative methods use a bath of isopentaneDifferent types of tissues cut optimally at different temperaturesMajority of tissue: -10 °C to -20 °CVery soft tissue (brain, spleen, adrenal gland, lymph node): -7 °C to -10 °CAdipose tissue: -20 °C to -40 °CMethods to Accelerate FreezingHeat extractorThis is a metal block that may be attached to a handle and is kept cold in cryostatAfter the embedding medium is slightly cooled (and appears opaque), the extractor can be placed on top of the blockIt should not be used immediately as it will compress and distort tissue that is still softThe use of the heat extractor creates a flat surfaceIf the extractor sticks to the block, the stem of the chuck can be gently knocked against the freezing plateIf the block detaches from the chuck, it can be reattached to a new chuck with embedding mediumA small amount of oil on an extractor can prevent stickingCooling plateSome cryostats have a quick freeze option that cools the plateAfter embedding medium is opaque, the block is placed face down on the plateRapid freezing aerosol spraySprays are available to cool the face of the block quicklyThere are multiple formulationsMany use carbon dioxide and propellantNot recommended due to increased risk of inhalation of infectious disease organisms or toxic fumesExposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis is reported after use of this type of spray on infected tissueIf used, spray should be within cryostat with lid closed as much as possible to contain sprayCryostat should be free of shavings that will contribute to contaminationFace masks should be wornSectioning on CryostatThe chuck is positioned in the microtome such that the blade 1st cuts the most solid area of tissueSolid areas of tissue should be positioned closest to the bladeAdipose tissue should not be 1st portion of tissue cutEpidermal or mucosal surfaces should be perpendicular to the bladeThe most important part of the tissue should not be the 1st area cutThe leading edge of the section is the area of tissue most likely to show artifacts of compression or foldingThe blade must be sharp and without nicks in order to create complete thin sectionsDull or nicked blades result in sections with chatter artifact &/or holesThe block is trimmed or faced until a complete section is obtainedBases can be prefaced prior to adding a specimen to minimize tissue loss when facing blockRough cut sections can be removed from the blade with a large brush or swabDiscarded sections should be brushed away in the same direction as the blade cutsThe blade can be nicked or dulled if brushedDiscarded sections should never be removed by hand due to the risk of severe laceration from the bladeSome cryostats use an antiroll plate to hold the cut tissue section flat against plateThe tissue section is left slightly attached to the block to prevent curlingAs an alternative to an antiroll plate, a brush can be usedThe tissue section is guided onto the plate with a brush at the leading edge of the tissue sectionThe section is left slightly attached to the block to prevent curlingBrushes are kept cold within cryostatA glass slide is gently applied to the surface of the tissue sectionSlides should be labeled with the case number and a designation for frozen sectionThe label must be able to withstand solutions used for stainingFrozen tissue rapidly melts onto a slide at room temperatureFixationAs soon as slides are prepared, they must be immediately placed in methanolA methanol container with a slide holder should be within easy reach of the cryostatAny delay results in significant air-drying artifact, which impedes interpretationDisposition of Frozen TissueThe remaining tissue should be fixed in formalin and submitted for permanent sectionIf multiple chucks are present in the cryostat, each one can be identified by labeling the surface with a felt tip markerThe frozen tissue block can be immersed in formalin to cause slight melting and removed with a hand or rulerFrozen tissue should not be removed using a bladeThe chuck is small and the tissue block is hard; the force required to sever the block can result in loss of control of the blade and injury to the nondominant handSmall frozen section remnants are wrapped in lens paper before being placed in a labeled cassetteExcess embedding medium should be trimmed awayThe comparison of the frozen section to the permanent section is an important quality assurance parameterIf there is a difference in interpretation, the surgeon must be notified and the reason for the discrepancy explained in the pathology reportIf frozen tissue is required for ancillary studies, and additional tissue is not available for freezing, the frozen section remnant can be retained for this purposeLevelsIf very little tissue is present, the initial levels should be shallow to ensure some tissue is captured before all tissue is sectionedSequential levels can be taken for staining rather than going deep into sectionIf a large section is present, or if multiple fragments are present, the frozen section should be a representative cross section of all tissueAfter cutting and fixing, all tissue in the block should be represented on the slideIf not, deeper levels should be takenImportant diagnostic information can be lost if some tissue is not presentDeep levels can be helpful when examining margins to look for small areas of tumor near the marginRequires cutting deep into section and discarding some of the intervening tissueDeep levels should not be used for small biopsies of diagnostic tissue if the tissue is limitedAt least 2 levels should be obtained for each frozen sectionEvaluation of Lung Parenchymal Resection Margin With StaplesClinical settingPreservation of lung parenchyma may be important for patients with compromised lung function or if multiple lesions are presentThe true margin is the tissue within staple line~ 2-3 mm of lung parenchyma is within staple lineStaples cannot be removed from the fresh specimen as this results in tearing of tissue precluding optimal evaluationFor some patients, evaluation of the true margin is of value in order to document a cancer-free margin and to avoid unnecessary removal of additional tissueSurgical techniqueThis method can only be used for staples that do not interlockMethodThe outer edge of the staple line is inkedThe lung specimen is sectioned perpendicular to the staple line to determine the location of the tumor and the distance from the staple lineThe section of tissue with the closest approach of tumor to staple line is identifiedThe portion of the section containing staples is cut with scissorsThe block on the chuck is positioned in the cryostat such that the blade passes 1st through the edge of the tissue containing staplesThe block is faced until the blade hits a staple or a staple can be seenThe blade hitting a staple makes a grating soundStaples cause tears in sectionThe chuck is removed from the cryostatForceps are used to pull the staple (or staples; generally no more than 1-2) from the blockBecause the tissue is frozen in place, minimal tearing occurs when staples are removedRemoving staples should not be attempted in the cryostatProximity to the blade could result in serious lacerationAfter staples are removed, the surface of the block is covered again with embedding medium and refrozen in the cryostatThe chuck is positioned in the cryostat in the same orientationA new cryostat blade (or new area of the same blade) should be used as there may be nicks caused by the staplesSections are cut from the blockThe tissue where the staples were located will look pinched on the slidesOval holes in the tissue identify the site of where the staples were removedThe true margin is the tissue at the inked edge beyond the holesTROUBLESHOOTINGSection Shows Shatter (or Chatter) ArtifactThe appearance is similar to a Venetian blindDue to breaks in tissue parallel to bladeBlock too coldThe block can be slightly warmed with a thumb or palmThe section must be cut immediately because the block will rapidly coolMost superficial section may be too warmA few sections may need to be discarded to get to a level with optimum temperature for sectioningCare must be taken to prevent injury to the handMove block as far from blade as possibleLock handwheel to prevent block from movingCryostat blade dull, nicked, or missingReplace with new bladeMake sure blade has been installedTissue too hardFragments of bone or other calcified tissue may be too hard to sectionTissue that cannot be cut easily with a scalpel should not be selected for frozen sectionIf possible, soft tissue should be separated away from hard tissueSection is not cut in continuous motionThe handwheel should be turned with a smooth motionHesitation or stopping before completing a section can result in tearsSections Crumple Into Mass on BladeBlock too warmLeave block in cryostat longerAfter initial sections, center of block may not be sufficiently coldUse heat extractor or other mechanism to cool block rapidlyBlade is at wrong angleAngle should be adjusted to 30°Edge of section may not be transferring well to plateUse brush to catch leading edge of section and guide onto plateIf there is excessive embedding medium, cut down to V shape around tissueTip of V is easier to catch with a brushIf using a plate to hold sections, check adjustmentFrozen Block Falls Off ChuckBlock may be knocked off chuck by bladeChuck may be loose, blade may be at wrong angle, or section width may be too thickBlock may stick to heat extractor and detach from chuckA drop of oil on the surface of the heat extractor will keep it from sticking to the blockThe block can be reattached to new chuck using embedding medium; allow to cool before cuttingBlade Does Not Cut BlockBase is softAllow more time for freezingA previously prepared base is usedBases that go through freeze and thaw cycles overnight will be soft and crumblyThe blade may push embedding medium down rather than cutting through itAll bases should be newly prepared same dayVery Small SpecimensIt can be challenging to capture enough of a small specimen for diagnosisTouch preparations may be adequate for some small specimensThe base can be prefaced in the cryostat to avoid loss of any tissue when facing tissue for frozen sectionsTissue can be dipped in eosin to aid in identifying it when covered with embedding mediumEosin does not interfere with normal stainingTissue can be placed in a drop of embedding medium placed on top of a cooled chuck (\"wet embedding\")The heat extractor is held gently on top of the embedding medium in order to not crush tissue before it is adequately frozenHelps prevent ice crystal artifactAdipose TissueFatty tissue is very difficult to cut wellIf fatty tissue is not important for the diagnosis, as much as possible should be trimmed awayLymph nodes are more easily examined when there is minimal fat attachedThe block may cut better when colder than normal for frozen sections (< -20 °C down to -50 °C)If other methods do not work, thicker sections can be cutThick and Thin SectionsChuck or blade are looseThe stem of the chuck must be firmly attached to the cryostatThe blade must be firmly attachedAir-Drying ArtifactAfter staining, cells look splayed out with smudgy chromatin and indistinct cell bordersA jar of fixative must be kept very close to the cryostatSlides must be fixed immediately after sectioningIce Crystal ArtifactTissue is riddled with holes or looks compressed due to formation of large ice crystalsTissue is

orientation is necessary to determine the distance of malignancies from marginsClose or positive margins may be an indication for additional removal of tissue in designated areasSurgeon should indicate if margin evaluation is needed for intraoperative managementPathologist should always verify orientation provided by surgeonAny questions about orientation should be addressed prior to further specimen processingTechniquesSuturesSurgeons may place multiple sutures to indicate specific marginsSeveral methods are used to indicate margins identified by suturesDifferent materials of different colorsDifferent lengths (e.g., short = superior margin; long = lateral margin; often used for breast specimens)Tied suture vs. blanket stitchDifferent numbers of surgical clips or commercial markers attached to suturesSutures of different colors should be documented before inkingLight-colored sutures may be difficult to distinguish after being inkedDiagramA good method to indicate orientation for complex specimensSeparate specimensEach margin may be sent as separate excisionINKING MARGINSMethodsIn general, ink should be applied to specimens prior to sectioningSpecimen surface should be dry and clean (i.e., without gross blood)Gauze pads or cotton swabs are used to apply inkInk should not be introduced into crevices or other areas of a specimen that are not true marginsFor large complex specimens, it may be preferable to ink selective areasInking entire specimen may make later orientation and identification of structures difficultArtifactual smearing of ink onto nonmargins can occurOften possible to identify most important margins to examine by frozen section with consultation with surgeonOnly those margins need be inked for IOCOrientation of uninked specimen will be easier to determine by prosectorIt is helpful for institutions to develop routine policies for correlation of colors with specific marginsIdeally, the same color should always be used for the same marginPROCESSING THE SPECIMENImagingInformation from preoperative imaging is often helpful to guide gross examinationSize, location, and number of lesions is usually known preoperativelyIf a specimen (e.g., breast biopsy) undergoes imaging after excision, the specimen radiograph should be available to the pathologistThe radiograph is helpful to identify lesion type (mass, calcifications, clip, radioactive seed), location, and radiologic distance to marginsMethodsStandard methods for processing specimens should be usedSurgeon should provide information about structures present and mark any that are not grossly evidentAll external anatomic structures must be identified prior to inking the specimenInk can make it more difficult to identify structures and marking devices (i.e., clips or sutures)Minimal examination (e.g., not completely sectioning specimen) may lead to suboptimal evaluationAdditional lesions smaller than the primary lesion may be missedClosest approach of malignancy to margin may not be identifiedSpecimens must be examined on a clean surface away from other specimensContamination from other specimens can create diagnostic errorsScalpels, other blades, forceps, and probes must be new or meticulously cleaned if previously usedGloves and other protective clothing must be cleanLarge, potentially cystic masses must be opened with careA deceptively firm to hard mass can actually be a cystic tumor with fluid under pressureA puncture can result in forceful expulsion of cyst contents with contamination of environment and prosectorPossible cysts should be opened carefully, preferably near a sink or with abundant pads capable of absorbing any contentsA small nick should be made on the surface away from prosectorSpecimens can change shape and size after excisionColonColon segments can contract 40% within 10-20 minutesDistances of rectal carcinomas to the distal margin should be measured as soon as possibleThis distance may be used to determine the need for radiation therapySkeletal muscleSkeletal muscle in resections can contract when cut with a blade (e.g., resections for sarcomas of thigh)This phenomenon can be quite alarming when 1st encounteredSkinContraction occurs within 5 minutes of excisionBreastExcisions flatten spontaneously or due to compression during specimen radiographySectioningSharp blades must be usedDull blades are difficult to use and may result in injury to prosectorTissue may be crushed rather than cutDifficult to obtain sections of optimal thinness for frozen section and fixationParallel sections preferable to multiple cuts in different planesPreserves ability to orient specimenEnsures the entire specimen is examinedHowever, perpendicular sections in different planes may be necessary to evaluate multiple margins of some specimensA single large cut to bisect a large, complex specimen may be adequate in order to identify tissue for ancillary testingThe best area of tumor for studies can be identified (central or periphery)If multiple areas of different gross appearances are present, it may be helpful to take paired samples for histology and ancillary testingThe specimen orientation is maintained for further dissection and photographyHollow organs should be opened such that a tumor is not transected, when possibleInformation from imaging or endoscopy may be helpful to identify the tumor locationThe outer surface can be palpated to identify the location of a massA finger can be introduced (e.g., into a colon segment) to identify the massOpening all hollow organs is often helpful to orient the specimen and to identify structuresIMPORTANT GROSS FEATURESSize of TumorsSize should be carefully determined and recorded in fresh, unfixed tissueThe final size should be correlated with microscopic appearance on permanent sectionsImportant for staging of some tumorsMay diminish slightly after fixationMay be difficult to determine after sectioningMay be difficult to determine if tissue is taken for special studiesSize prior to removing tissue must be documentedDistance of Malignancies From MarginsOften used to determine adequacy of surgical resectionAdequate margin varies for different types of tumors, sites, and clinical settingse.g., the distance of rectal carcinomas from the distal margin may be used to determine the need for radiation therapyThe gross distance from the margins should always be correlated with microscopic appearanceA margin grossly far from a tumor should not be interpreted as positive on microscopic examination unless a clear reason for discrepancy is identifiedTumor has a diffusely infiltrative pattern not appreciated grosslyTumor is present in tissue plane not seen grossly (e.g., esophageal adenocarcinoma present in muscularis propria at margin beneath grossly negative squamous mucosa)2nd smaller focus of tumor present at marginOther possibilities should be considered before interpreting such a margin as positiveInk leakage into specimen fissures or artifactually introduced onto nonmargin surfacesTumor present in lymphatics that would not be an indication for additional surgery (e.g., at bronchial margin)Nonmalignant cells that could be misinterpreted as malignancy (e.g., atypical ductal hyperplasia in breast excision)Multiple TumorsMultiple tumor masses may be present due to numerous reasonsArea of carcinoma in situ giving rise to multiple invasive cancersIntralymphatic tumor giving rise to multiple metastatic sitesFragmentation of a single tumor due to transection during surgeryMultiple biologically separate tumorsMore common in patients with germline mutations (e.g., breast cancer) or environmental exposures (e.g., skin carcinoma in sun-damaged skin)Multiple tumors are important to recognize when taking tissue for ancillary studies and for margin evaluationILLUSTRATIONPhotographyA photograph of the intact specimen is useful for later documentationCan be helpful to identify location of sections for margin evaluationPhotographs of typical and unusual lesions are useful for teachingPathologic findings are best demonstrated when a specimen is freshDiagramsSimple diagrams can be used to document important featuresLocation and relationship of structures and lesions presentLocation and colors of inksSites where tissue has been sampledTISSUE ALLOCATIONDocumentationDistribution of all tissue from surgical specimen should be documentedSize and types of tissue sent to other laboratories should be recordedLaboratory, investigator, or other identifying information should be includedIn rare cases, tissue may need to be retrieved if inappropriate tissue is allocated or there is an unexpected diagnosis on permanent sectionsTissue saved by means other than standard formalin fixation is documentedFormalin FixationIn general, at least some tissue should be fixed in a standard manner in formalinThe majority of studies of immunohistochemical markers have been performed on formalin-fixed tissueFormalin penetrates slowly, and complete fixation may require many hoursSpecimens should be serially sectioned to ensure all areas are adequately exposed to fixativeIf a specimen is large and complete fixation may be delayed, thin slices of tumor should be fixed quickly in a separate formalin containerIt may be helpful to include normal tissue as a control for immunohistochemical studiese.g., normal breast tissue can be combined with breast carcinoma as control for hormone receptorsIdeally, fixation occurs within 1-2 hours after blood supply is terminatedBiomolecules degrade at different ratesPhosphoproteins and mRNA can degrade within minutesOther types of proteins and DNA may degrade after hoursThe time when a specimen is placed into fixative should be documented when feasibleOther FixativesTissue may be saved in other types of fixatives when appropriateHistologic features of lymphomas often best preserved in special fixativesElectron MicroscopyTissue must be minced into small fragments (~ 1 mm x 1 mm x 1 mm) for rapid fixationSpecial fixation is necessary to preserve ultrastructural detailFlow CytometryTissue must be unfixedTissue should be kept moist in

        "raw_text": "IntroductionClinical SettingThe intraoperative detection of a lymph node metastases can be important for the management of patients with cancerComplete axillary dissection may be performed for some patients Positive palpable nodes3 or more positive nodesPositive nodes after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT)There is no need for intraoperative consultation unless lymph node status will alter the surgical planResection for a possible cure may not be attempted for sites such as the pancreas or lungRemoval of additional nodes after a positive node is identified may not be required for staging and often increases morbidityReverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect mRNA transcripts specific to epithelial cells has been proposed as an alternative to frozen section (FS) for the diagnosis of metastasesThe majority of investigations have studied breast cancer, but lung, colorectal, gastric, gynecologic, prostate, and head and neck cancers have also been studiedReverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain ReactionMethodProbes for mRNA transcripts are used to amplify corresponding sequences from mRNA prepared from lymph nodesThe transcripts are chosen to represent genes transcribed in the majority of epithelial cells but not in hematopoietic cellsMultiple methods have been investigated but only 1 is currently commercially availableOne-Step Nucleic Acid AmplificationMarketed by Sysmex Corporation in Hyogo, Japan (LYNOAMP)Uses 6 primers to amplify mRNA for CK19Adopted in ~ 290 hospitals worldwide, including > 10% of hospitals in the United KingdomNot used widely in the United StatesA lysate is made from a lymph node and analyzed by a proprietary deviceAn RT loop-mediated isothermic amplification is used to detect the targeted sequenceThe number of mRNA copes per μl is determined and used to classify the type of metastasisThe lower level of detection is set to attempt to not detect isolated tumor cellsComparison of Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction and Frozen SectionTypes of Diseases DetectedFS detects all types of disease processes in lymph nodesIn addition to carcinoma, FS detects melanoma, lymphoma, infections, and other lesionsRT-PCR only detects mRNA transcripts from epithelial cellsClassification of MetastasesTraditionally, lymph node metastases have been classified as macrometastases, micrometastases, and isolated tumor cells based on sizeRT-PCR uses the number of mRNA transcripts to approximate the size of the metastasisThe number of mRNA transcripts is only loosely related to the amount of protein present and may not always accurately reflect the amount of tumor presentMisclassification in comparison to size by histology is likely for some casesWhether or not the size of a metastasis as determined by FS or the number of mRNA transcripts is preferable for clinical use has not yet been determined for all tumors and applicationsExtent of Metastatic Disease DetectedBoth RT-PCR and FS are very effective at detecting macrometastases (> 97% sensitivity)RT-PCR detects ~ 2-4x as many micrometastases compared to FSWith conventional lymph node evaluation, ~ 20-25% of all metastases are micrometastasesWith RT-PCR, the number of micrometastases can be similar or greater to the number of macrometastasesThe clinical utility of finding small metastases may vary with the tumor type and clinical settinge.g., small metastases have little prognostic importance for breast cancers in the absence of NATThe prognostic significance of very small metastases after NAT needs to be determinedMore patients will be classified as having positive lymph nodes with RT-PCRRT-PCR can quantify metastases that are present as multiple foci within a single node or involving multiple nodesThe total tumor load (the number of mRNA transcripts added across multiple nodes) can be determinedThis is being investigated as a predictor of nonsentinel node metastasisFalse-Negative and False-Positive ResultsThe RT-PCR false-positive rate is reported to be ~ 2.5% if tissue allocation is excludedPossible causes are leaky transcription from nonepithelial cells, contamination of the specimen, or benign epithelial inclusionsThe reasons are difficult to study because the entire node is utilized for the assayFS results in only very rare false-positive results (< 1%)The RT-PCR false-negative rate is reported to be ~ 8% if tissue allocation is excludedPossible causes are cancers that do not express the evaluated keratin, necrotic carcinomas, or carcinomas with cautery artifactFS results in only very false-negative results for macrometastases (< 3%)However, metastases < 0.2 cm in size may or may not be detected as not all tissue is evaluatedTissue Allocation for Lymph Node EvaluationIn validation studies, nodes were evaluated by both H&E and one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA)Alternate slices were allocated to OSNA and histopathologyDiscordant results due to tissue allocation are inevitableSuboptimal results can result for both techniquesFalse-negative results occur due to the metastasis not being in the tissue allocatedThe mRNA transcript number may be reduced if the entire node is not evaluated, potentially resulting in incorrect classificationA positive result by OSNA and a negative result by H&E [i.e., AJCC pN0 (mol+)] leaves patients not knowing whether or not metastatic disease is presentMolecular result may be false-positive resultMolecular method may detect minimal tumor involvement not detected by histopathologyMolecular method may detect a macrometastasis that was missed by histopathology due to tissue allocationTherefore, appropriate node classification could be N0, N0 (i+), N1mi, or N1Thus, for clinical use, it is preferable to evaluate a lymph node by either FS or OSNA but to not use both for the same lymph node",

usedCartilageCauterized tissueUnstained coated slides in fixative may be submitted to the histology laboratory for special stains in some situationsIf infectious disease is suspected, slides can be submitted for special stains that will be available in a few hours or early the following dayLabelingSlides are labeled with the surgical pathology number and subdesignation for specific frozen sectionLabel slides before use to prevent specimen mix-upsUnused labeled slides should be discardedUse pencil or a type of marker that will not be dissolved during the staining processLabel identifies side of slide onto which tissue will be placedWithout label, tissue may be picked up on back of slideTissue will likely be wiped off when drying slides after stainingFIXATION AND AIR-DRYINGTypes of Fixatives95% ethanol, methanol, acetone, and combinations of fixatives can be used95% ethanol is most commonIt is very important to fix slide as soon as section is cutContainer of fixative should be kept at hand to allow immediate immersionProlonged time to fixation results in air drying and alters histologic appearanceLoss of nuclear detail with smudging of chromatinArtifactual enlargement of cells and nucleiArchitecture not well preserved (cell borders obscured)Slides should be in fixative for at least 30-50 secondsLonger fixation is not harmfulFixative should be at room temperature for optimal effectAir-Dried SlidesUsually used for cytologic preparationsSlides must be completely dry, which may take several minutesMethods to heat slides can speed the processDiff-Quik, rapid Papanicolaou, and other stains are usedBrings out certain cytologic featuresCells appear larger, and this may aid in evaluationCytoplasmic features easier to visualizeMucosubstances stainedThyroid colloid preservedCould be potential infectious hazard if not stained and coverslippedIn general, such slides should be discarded when no longer needed for diagnosisSTAINSH&EStandard stain for frozen sectionsProcedureHematoxylin for 60-90 seconds (cytologic preparations can be stained for 30 seconds)Blot excess dye on absorbent materialStains nuclei blueShade of blue should be appropriate to

of slide next to mounting mediumEdge of coverslip should touch both slide and mounting mediumMounting medium should spread between slide and coverslip by capillary actionCoverslip is eased onto slide as mounting medium spreads, being careful to not introduce bubblesBack and edges of slides are wiped &/or blotted to remove excess xylene and mounting mediumDISPOSITION OF SLIDESStorageOriginal frozen section slides should be preservedGood practice to store original frozen section slide with permanent slides for review at sign-out of caseComparison of frozen section slide and permanent section made from tissue remnant is usefulDocumentation of a finding only seen on frozen sectionA small lesion may only be present on frozen section and not on deeper levels for permanent sectionsIf an important finding is not present on all frozen section slides, the best slide should be marked for use in later correlationQuality assurance measure: Frozen section diagnosis should be reevaluated after review of entire caseIf an error is found, it should be documented in the report and immediately communicated to the surgeon and other treating physiciansAnalysis of cause of errors is very useful teaching

largely replaced FS was the rapid parathyroid hormone (PTH) assay developed in 1994A drop in the PTH level occurs within minutes when a hyperfunctioning adenoma is removedSurgeons use the PTH level to guide intraoperative managementFS for the identification of adenomas is now rarely performedCurrently, there are numerous alternative approaches to intraoperative diagnosis that are replacing, or may replace, FS in the near futureSome of these methods require the involvement of pathologists, and others replace pathology interpretation with optical or chemical/molecular analyses that are directly available to the surgeonMany of these methods are being combined with artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) to assist in the interpretation of the dataAI/ML programs could potentially provide diagnostic information to the surgeon without the need for pathologic consultationIt is important for pathologists to be aware of techniques that may become part of their diagnostic armamentarium, as well as techniques that will not be used by pathologists but will need to be validated against the current standard of careEX VIVO MICROSCOPY: FRESH TISSUEOverviewMultiple methods are under development to obtain high-resolution microscopic images directly from fresh tissueThe tissue is not damaged by the procedure and is used for routine fixation and processing for histologic evaluationMajor advantages for intraoperative consultation are the avoidance of freezing (and freezing artifact), no potential loss of tissue, the rapid acquisition of digital images, and the possibility of remote diagnosis (telepathology)In addition to the following 3 methods described, additional methods in development include structured illumination microscopy, light sheet microscopy, microscopy using ultraviolet surface excitation (MUSE), and microscopy, as well as othersStimulated Raman Histology Simulated Raman histology (SRH) refers to high-resolution images closely resembling H&E sections created by contrast from the vibrational properties of molecules (lipids, proteins, nucleic acids) without the need for exogenous labelingDevices using this technology are commercially availableA major advantage is that no treatment of the tissue is required in order to obtain high-resolution subcellular detailThe tissue is placed into a special glass slide that lightly compresses the tissue to create a flat planeThe surface of the specimen is imaged as a flat planeImage acquisition requires ~ 2.5 minutesThe images are processed to render H&E-like pseudocoloringPathologists can interpret the images with minimal additional trainingOptical Coherence TomographyOptical coherence tomography (OCT) uses the detection of gated backscattered light arising from illuminated tissue to create a high-resolution, cross-sectional tomographic imageDevices using this technology are commercially availableNo pretreatment of the tissue is necessaryAn advantage to this technique is that there is greater tissue penetration (2-3 mm)However, there is lower resolution compared to other techniques: The images are in grayscale and primarily show structures rather than individual cellsA current application is for the evaluation of breast marginsMargins are imaged using slight compression with a glass plate to obtain a flat surfaceA region 10 x 10 cm in area and 2 mm in depth can be imaged in < 10 minutes to ~ 15- to 30-μm resolutionInterpretation requires special training because the images do not resemble conventional H&E slidesConfocal MicroscopyConfocal microscopy (CM) uses lasers of different wavelengths to detect tissue reflectance and block out-of-focus lightDevices using this technology are commercially availableThe area of the image varies with the device and ranges from 2-8 cmThe method measures fluorescence emitted from tissue, which can either be from endogenous autofluorescence or from the use of exogenous fluorescent dyesTreating the tissue with a fluorescent dye provides additional cellular detailStaining requires < 1 minuteThe surface of the specimen is imaged as a flat planeImage acquisition requires < 5 minutesThe images are processed to render H&E-like pseudocoloringPathologists can interpret the images with minimal additional trainingIN VIVO MICROSCOPY: PATIENTSOverviewSome of the methods used for ex vivo microscopy are being adapted for in vivo microscopyThese methods have the potential to provide the equivalent of high-resolution H&E microscopic images directly from tissue in patients and may eliminate or reduce the need to remove tissue for diagnosisPossible applications being explored include the followingCatheters: Lumina of ducts and blood vesselsLaparoscopic probes: Pleural and peritoneal surfacesEndoscopes: Gastrointestinal tract, lung, endometriumNeedle probes: Breast, liver, subcutaneous masses, many othersIngested capsules: Gastrointestinal tractTUMORS VISUALIZED USING FLUORESCENCEOverviewFluorescence-guided surgery uses the selective uptake &/or activation of dyes to identify tumorsPatients are injected with a fluorophore prior to surgeryIndocyanine green (ICG) is an FDA-approved imaging dye detected by near-infrared imagingAccumulates in tumor cells due to the abnormal neovasculatureLUM015 dye is activated by cathepsin to release an optically active fluorophore in areas of tumorProteases are more abundant in areas of the tumor microenvironmentLight sources in the operating room are used to excite and illuminate the fluorophorePenetration can be 1-2 cm when excitation wavelengths in the near infrared are usedPossible applications includeIdentification and excision of relatively superficial tumorsEvaluation of margins for residual tumorIdentification of unsuspected areas of disease (e.g., peritoneal metastases)Identification of sentinel nodes by injecting a fluorescent dye into lymphaticsFluorescence may be easier for the surgeon to identify compared to methylene blueFluorescence-Detecting Handheld ProbesProbes can be used by the surgeon to detect areas of fluorescence in the operative field and in excised specimensThis method may be most useful for the evaluation of margins after excisionFluorescence-Detecting Surgical GogglesSpecially designed augmented reality goggles allow surgeon to see areas of fluorescence within operative fieldThe hands-free operation may be superior for using this method intraoperativelyMARGINS EVALUATED USING SPECTROSCOPY-ENABLED HANDHELD PROBESOverviewSpectroscopy has been used to analyze tissue at the surfaces of specimens in order to determine if normal or abnormal tissue is presentCurrently marketed devices have been developed to specifically aid the surgeon in detecting cancer at the margins of breast excisionsMarginProbe Radiofrequency Spectroscopy System (Dune Medical Devices, Inc.)The probe measures local electrical properties in the radiofrequency range of breast tissue in order to distinguish benign and malignant tissueThe surgeon touches the probe to the outer surface of a breast specimenThe probe applies an electrical field to the tissue via a sensor at the tipA pneumatic system attaches the probe to the tissue and can only be used onceThe device provides a positive (malignant) or negative (benign) readout within secondsA specimen must be analyzed within 20 minutes after excision~ 5 minutes is required to scan an entire specimenMargins found to be positive can be reexcised in the same procedureIn order to have a high sensitivity to detect all carcinomas, the false-positive rate is ~ 30-50%ClearEdge (LS BioPath)This probe uses bioimpedance spectroscopy to distinguish normal from abnormal tissueThe surgeon touches the probe to the outer surface of a breast specimenThe device provides a normal (green or yellow) or abnormal (red) signal within secondsMargins found to have abnormal tissue can be reexcised in the same procedureTUMORS DIAGNOSED USING AEROSOLS GENERATED BY SURGICAL TOOLSOverviewMinute samples of disaggregated tissue can be identified as tumor or normal tissue using mass spectroscopy to analyze the chemical compositionThe tissue is destroyed during the process and thus cannot be evaluated using other methodsSurgical tools have been combined with probes that create and collect these samplesiKnife The iKnife (Medimass) is a surgical scalpel that provides information about the tissue it contactsElectrocautery from the iKnife creates an aerosol of tissueThe aerosol is aspirated and transferred by an air pump for analysis using rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS)An ML algorithm analyzes the data and provides a readout of positive (malignant) and negative (benign)The information can be provided to the surgeon immediately, either visually on a screen or via an audio signalThis method has been used to evaluate the margins of breast specimensCavitron Ultrasonic Surgical AspiratorTumors are dissected using ultrasonic tissue ablationThe resulting disaggregated tissue is analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy and has been used to identify tumor type, grade, and marginsThe analysis has been reported to be capable of identifying tumor type and gradeSpiderMassThis tool uses an infrared laser to excite water molecules for water-assisted laser desorption ionization (WALDI) mass spectroscopy analysisThe tip of the probe takes a small sample of the tissue (~ 0.1 mm)An advantage of this technique over the iKnife and Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA) is that the tissue is relatively undamagedThis allows the tool to be used to analyze the tissue composition of core needle biopsies to distinguish normal tissue from malignancy and areas of necrosisPotentially, it could also be used to evaluate other types of surgical specimensIn pilot studies, the analysis has been able to identify tumor type and gradeThis method could potentially be incorporated into a surgical tool that would provide real-time diagnostic information to the surgeon for diagnosis and margin evaluationLYMPH NODE METASTASES DETECTED USING RAPID REVERSE-TRANSCRIPTASE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTIONOverviewMetastatic carcinoma can be detected in lymph nodes by the presence of mRNA transcripts for proteins expressed by epithelial but not hematopoietic cellsIn the majority of cases, these cells are due to metastatic carcinoma; however, benign epithelial inclusions and contamination are also potential sourcesA rapid reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is used to determine the number of mRNA transcripts using a lysate from a lymph nodeIf the entire node is evaluated, the tissue is consumed in the process and cannot be evaluated using conventional pathologic evaluationThe majority of studies have evaluated axillary nodes for breast cancer, but the method is also being investigated for other types of carcinomaFS can not only detect carcinomas but also melanomas, lymphomas, infections, and other pathologic processes in lymph nodesIn contrast, RT-PCR can only detect cells with the target mRNAOne-Step Nucleic Acid AmplificationOne-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) is used in some centers to detect epithelial cells in lymph nodes by quantifying mRNA transcripts for CK19Both FS and OSNA are highly effective at detecting macrometastases (> 0.2 cm)OSNA detects more micrometastases, but the value of finding small metastases intraoperatively to guide axillary lymph node dissection is debatedThe use of OSNA to evaluate lymph nodes for other types of tumors is currently under investigationSTEATOSIS EVALUATED BY PHOTOGRAPHEvaluation of Livers Prior to TransplantationHepatic steatosis (HS) is associated with poor function and graft survival rate after transplantationDonor livers are currently evaluated by FS for HS as well as other findings that can alter graft functionIn one study, a photograph of a liver taken with a smartphone and donor data were analyzed by an ML algorithm to predict livers with > or < 30% HS as determined by FSDonor data included age, weight, height, liver enzymes, and liver/spleen attenuation ratio from a CT studyThe program was able to predict non-HS with a sensitivity of 97% and HS with a sensitivity of 93%Limitations of the study are the small number of livers evaluated and the inability to distinguish micro- from macrosteatosis as well as to detect other unfavorable histologic featuresAuthors suggest that this type of analysis could assist transplant surgeons in evaluating livers in a noninvasive manner and when pathologic assistance is not available",

        "raw_text": "INTRODUCTIONEx Vivo MicroscopyEx vivo microscopy (EVM) encompasses multiple methods used to obtain images from fresh tissue at microscopic resolution by analyzing reflected light of differing wavelengths2D and 3D images, either static or video, can be renderedSome methods use unprocessed tissue, whereas others treat the tissue with fluorescent dyesThe tissue is not altered by EVM and can be used for routine fixation and tissue processingEx vivo images are processed to render H&E-like pseudocoloringBy producing images similar to that of glass slides, pathologists can interpret EVM images without additional trainingThe same methods could potentially be modified for in vivo microscopy of tissue in patients and would reduce or eliminate the need for removal of tissuee.g., instead of performing a core needle biopsy, a probe could be placed into a lesion and an image acquired for diagnosisApplications for Ex Vivo Microscopy in PathologyThere are many specific attributes of EVM that provide new opportunities for pathologic evaluationRapid diagnosisSome EVM methods can acquire images in < 5 minutesRapid diagnosis has many applicationsIntraoperative diagnosis currently used at some centersSame-day diagnosis of rush biopsies or for outpatient procedures (e.g., skin or breast biopsies)Determination of tissue adequacy for some procedures (e.g., renal biopsies)Helpful for selection of optimal samples for tissue bankingDirect acquisition of digital imagesDigital imaging facilitates the use of telepathologye.g., images can be viewed remotely to provide subspecialty opinion in locations without specific expertiseImages can be used to develop artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) methodsAI/ML programs are being investigated for use in the diagnosis and evaluation of prognostic and predictive markersDigital images have advantages for archival storage and retrievalLarger areas of tissue can be imagedSome methods can image areas of tissue up to 8 cmLarge microscopic images can provide additional information for the evaluation of specimens that are not always available with conventional glass slidesSizes of larger tumorsRelationships among multiple tumorsDistance to marginsThese images also could be used to guide block selection for optimal specimen gross evaluation and sampling3D imagingThe capacity to see tissue in 3D at a microscopic resolution provides information not previously available by gross or conventional microscopic evaluationCould be helpful for the evaluation of margins, particularly when complex structures are involved, such as the ductal system of the breastPotential Disadvantages of Ex Vivo MicroscopyEVM requires special equipment and additional training and increases costThe optimal platform for clinical use has not yet been determined (many are currently under development)In some methods, the images are of the surface of the specimenObtaining images at deeper levels is more challengingFine microtome sectioning of tissue for conventional levels may have advantages for the evaluation of very small lesionsArtifacts specific to the method used may be introducedLong-term storage of large digital files is problematic for many institutionsHow to incorporate immediate viewing of images into a routine pathology workflow to take advantage of rapid diagnostic capacity is unclearCombining digital ex vivo images with conventional glass slides into the patient's medical record may be challengingTYPES OF EX VIVO IMAGINGMethodsNumerous methods are currently under investigationSome methods are becoming commercially available, whereas others are in early developmentMethods vary with the need to treat the tissue prior to imaging, the size of the tissue that can be imaged, the depth of imaging, and the time required to obtain an imageMethods requiring staining with dyes may be limited for in vivo applicationsIn general, the methods do not alter the tissue, thus it can be used for routine fixation, tissue processing, staining, immunohistochemistry, and other techniquesStimulated Raman HistologyStimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy uses contrast created by vibrational properties of molecules within tissue (lipids, proteins, nucleic acids) to allow label-free optical sectioningAn optical imaging process employing fiber-laser scattering microscopy to create a rapid, high-resolution image from fresh tissue, closely resembling an H&E section, is termed stimulated Raman histology (SRH)A major advantage of this method is the ability to produce high-resolution images without the use of dyesImages are generally limited to the surface of the specimenDue to its ability to rapidly process brain tissue without damage, SRH has emerged as a leading technology for EVM of brain tissuesFluorescence Confocal MicroscopyFluorescence confocal microscopy (FCM) is a technique utilizing excitation of exogenous fluorophores (fluorescent dyes) that label nuclei to generate image contrastThe tissue is treated with a fluorescent dye to improve the recognition of cells and tissue architectureLarge tissue sections up to 8 cm can be imagedImages are generally limited to the surface of the specimenStructured Illumination MicroscopyStructured illumination microscopy (SIM) is an optimal sectioning microscopy process using patterned fluorescence excitationTissues are treated with a fluorescent dye; large specimens are able to be imagedImages are generally limited to the surface of the specimenNonlinear MicroscopyNonlinear microscopy (NLM) is multiphoton, 2-photon, and 2nd-harmonic generation microscopyTissues are treated with a fluorescent dyeCan image specimens to a depth of 100 μmOptical Coherence TomographyOptical coherence tomography (OCT) uses detection of a gated, backscattered light arising from illuminated tissue to create a high-resolution, cross-sectional tomographic imageCan be performed on untreated tissue without labelingCan image specimens to a depth of 2-3 mmThis capability is useful for evaluating specimen marginsThe lower resolution limits the utility for primary diagnosis but may be adequate for specific purposes, such as evaluating the margins of breast specimensThe images are grayscale and do not resemble conventional H&E slides; special training is required for interpretationLight Sheet MicroscopyLight sheet microscopy (LSM) is optical sectioning microscopy that removes out-of-focus light using a thin selective Illumination plane that generates fluorescence signals to be imagedRequires treatment of the tissue with fluorescent dyes3D volumetric imaging is possible for fresh or fixed tissue but requires tissue clearingCan reveal architectural aspects of pathologic processes not evident using conventional 2D imagesMicroscopy Using Ultraviolet Surface ExcitationOptical sectioning microscopy using ultraviolet surface excitation (MUSE) of tissueRequires treatment of the tissue with fluorescent dyesLarge specimens can be imagedCan image specimens to a depth of 1-10 μmEX VIVO MICROSCOPY FOR INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATIONGross Examination and Tissue PreparationThe following protocol is an example of how an EVM system using SRH is being used for intraoperative assessment of neurosurgical specimensThe portable EVM system is located in the ORThe device is about the size of a cryostat but is mounted on wheels and can easily be movedThe tissue biopsy is removed by the surgeonThe preferred size of tissue is ≤ 0.3 cm in the greatest dimension for optimal imaging

surfaceThe slide is inserted into the EVM platform for imagingStep-by-step instructions on docked screen are providedTissue ImagingAn integrated laser microscope acquires the image, which can be viewed in the OR on the docked screenA digital touch screen is used to zoom and scan the tissue image; acquisition of the image requires ~ 2.5 minutesEvaluation of ImagesThe pathologist can view the

        "raw_text": "THE ART OF INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATIONMore Than Pathology at High SpeedThere are significant differences compared to general pathology practiceThe major purpose of intraoperative consultation (IOC) is to answer a specific question required for directing surgeryThe diagnosis has an immediate impact on the care of the patientA definitive diagnosis is generally not necessary or optimalInformation should be limited to that essential for immediate management of the patientThe majority of special studies are not available; diagnosis is based almost exclusively on H&E slidesOnly limited sampling of large specimens is possible within time limitsA judicious interpretation of the findings is often necessary given the limitation of frozen sectionsA conservative approach, but not too conservative, is appropriateDegrees of uncertainty when a definitive diagnosis is not possible may need to be shared with the surgeonIOC is time limitedIdeally, an answer is available to the surgeon within 20 minutesTakes precedence over all other activitiesIn most institutions, a pathologist is available on call for IOC at all timesDirect interaction between the pathologist and surgeon is preferredPrecise oral and written communication is essentialOften occurs at a site distant from the pathology departmentPathologists typically prefer using their own microscope in their own workspaceDoes not occur at a predetermined timeMay be requested at times outside normal working hours (e.g., nights and weekends)Reference material may be limited or difficult to access (e.g., books and journals)Online references can be available at any site with computer accessConsultation with colleagues is often not possibleNot subspecialized; pathologists often see specimens outside their areas of expertiseThe pathologist is a patient advocate during IOCShould only comply with requests for frozen section when they are in the best interest of the patientShould request additional biopsies when received material is not sufficient for diagnosisMust ensure that tissue is used 1st for diagnosis and clinical care and only 2nd for investigational studies and other usesExpertise is primarily acquired performing IOCsRequires long years of experience, many close calls, and a few errorsMore difficult to teach using books or lectures compared to other areas of pathology\"Pearls of experience\" are suggestions and advicePearls start as a grain of sand but gain value over timeLearning from errors is an excellent method to improve practice (especially when the errors are not yours)Goals of Intraoperative ConsultationThere are 3 principal reasons for immediate microscopic evaluation of specimens(1) Diagnosis to guide intra- or perioperative patient managementIdentification or confirmation of a pathologic processEvaluation of margins for a known malignancy(2) Confirmation of sufficient lesional tissue for eventual definitive diagnosisA definitive diagnosis is not always necessary during the operationThe pathologist confirms to the surgeon there is no need to remove additional tissueThis may avoid additional morbidity for the patient(3) Optimal processing of tissue for ancillary studies to be used for diagnosis, treatment, or researchOften important for lymphomas, sarcomas, and pediatric tumorsOther tumors requiring special handlingMost Common Diagnostic QuestionsDiagnosis of primary lesion (~ 20%)In many cases, preoperative diagnosis is possible using needle or endoscopic biopsiesIn some cases, a prior attempt may have been unsuccessful or contraindicated due to the location or type of lesionA definitive diagnosis need only be provided when relevant to immediate patient managementOften benign vs. malignant is sufficient for IOCHowever, for difficult cases, a deferred diagnosis is better than a wrong diagnosis that could lead to unnecessary surgeryEvaluation of margins for a known malignant tumor (~ 40%)Additional tissue may be taken to achieve negative margins in a single procedureAccuracy is generally very highIdentification of lymph node metastasis (~ 20%)Resection with curative intent may be canceled if metastatic disease is identifiedAdditional nodes may not need to be sampledPatients may be treated with systemic therapy prior to definitive resectionIf a positive sentinel node is identified, additional nodes may be excisedAdequacy of tissue for future diagnosis (~ 5%)In some cases, a definitive diagnosis during IOC is unnecessaryHowever, sufficient tissue must be obtained for an eventual diagnosisIf tissue is difficult to obtain, it is important to avoid the need for a 2nd invasive procedureA provisional diagnosis can aid in the allocation of tissue for ancillary studiesAncillary studies may be required for the final diagnosisTypically, lymphomas, small round blue cell tumors, and soft tissue tumorsFresh tissue may also be desirable for special studies to identify cellular constituents vulnerable to targeted therapyPatients may also consent to have tissue taken for tumor banksPathologists must request additional tissue when appropriateEvaluation of organ prior to transplant (< 5%)The scarcity of organs has resulted in the donor pool being expanded to include donors with possibly marginally functional organsIOC is important to avoid transplantation of organs with a high likelihood of failureEvaluation of organs prior to transplant can reduce poor outcomesChanges in Intraoperative Consultation Over TimeThe need for IOC changes as the treatment of patients changesConsultations becoming more commonEvaluation of lung lesions detected by screeningMore patients are undergoing screening for lung cancerLesions detected by screening are typically small or of low density (ground glass)Lesions can be difficult or impossible for the surgeon to palpateSpecial localization techniques may be requiredMore limited surgery may be considered for adenocarcinoma in situ or minimally invasive adenocarcinomaEvaluation of margins of partial nephrectomiesIncreased efforts are being made to preserve renal function to avoid the need for dialysisRadioactive seed retrievalRetrieval in the IOC room may be preferred to ensure all seeds are identified, documented, and stored until they can be disposed of safelyNipple margin of mastectomiesNipple-sparing mastectomies are increasingly used for breast cancer treatmentThe base of the nipple may be examined intraoperatively with removal of the nipple when carcinoma is detectedEvaluation of organs prior to transplantConsultations currently rarely performed Identification of parathyroid adenomasIntraoperative measurement of parathyroid hormone level is a useful functional assay that is used to guide surgerySentinel node evaluation for breast carcinomaStudies have shown good outcomes for carefully selected women with positive sentinel nodes without axillary dissectionIOC evaluation is unnecessary if the result will not alter the surgical planPrimary diagnosis of breast lesionsCore needle biopsies are highly accurate and allow decisions to be made concerning choice of surgery and systemic therapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant)Definitive surgery can be planned based on the core needle biopsy diagnosisLimitationsFrozen sections are not equivalent to the evaluation of specimens on permanent sectionsDiagnoses on frozen section should be limited to the information needed for intraoperative management of patientSamplingTissue sections must be small to freeze well and quicklyThe amount of tissue examined is less than that examined by permanent sectionsPearl of experience: The pathologist evaluating microscopic slides should always perform, or be aware of, the gross findingsIf macroscopic and microscopic findings are not compatible, an error should be consideredA good gross examination is often more accurate than a suboptimal microscopic sectionFor example, ink can often leak into specimens or smear, making it difficult to identify the true marginIce crystal artifactFreezing introduces permanent changes in tissues by disrupting cell membranes and other structuresAlthough artifact can be minimized by rapid freezing of small samples, it is usually presentArtifacts can make diagnosis difficult or even impossible in extreme casesNuclei can look larger and more variable in size and shapeHoles in tissue can mimic intracellular vacuoles or fatTissue should only be frozen if the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of compromising eventual diagnosisPearl of experience: Nonpathologists often do not understand that patients can be harmed by inappropriate freezing of tissue due to artifacts permanently introducedThis fact can be helpful as part of an explanation as to why a frozen section should not be performedTechnical issuesSome tissues (e.g., adipose tissue) do not freeze wellTissues may be cut thicklyTissue folds can complicate interpretationAbsence of special studiesHistochemical and immunohistochemical studies are generally not availableSome diagnoses require additional studiesInappropriate Intraoperative ConsultationsIf IOC is requested but the information is not needed for intraoperative or immediate perioperative patient management, the request may be inappropriateInappropriate IOC wastes valuable resources and timeCould delay appropriate IOC for other patientsGenerates unnecessary medical costMay compromise the ultimate diagnosisIOC unnecessary and potentially harmful to the patientCompletely freezing any lesion may preclude the ultimate definitive diagnosisFreezing artifact can obscure diagnostic featuresTissue loss can occur during sectioning in cryostatPigmented lesions of skin and small breast lesions should never be entirely frozenThese lesions should be diagnosed and features evaluated on optimal permanent sectionsFreezing artifact and potential loss of tissue can preclude making a definitive diagnosisThe pathologist must be an advocate for the patientThe surgeon must be informed as to why freezing the entire lesion could be harmful to the patientAlternatives can be discussed, such as expedited processing of permanent sectionsPearl of experience: There are rare occasions in which unusual requests for IOC are appropriateRather than refusing to do a frozen section, it can be more helpful to ask the surgeon how the examination would benefit the patientThe pathologist and surgeon can reach an agreement about the best course of actionUltimately, the pathologist must act in the best interest of the patientIOC unnecessary but not harmful to the patientThere is usually no need for frozen section diagnosis on a large tumor that has been completely excisedHowever, performing a frozen section on a small portion of tumor will not interfere with the eventual diagnosisThe surgeon may request IOC to provide information to the patient or familyThe request should be discussed with the surgeon to determine how intraoperative or immediate postoperative management would be changed by a diagnosisIf there would be no change, then discuss why frozen section is unnecessaryIn some cases, there may be clinical indications for a diagnosis of which the pathologist is not awarePearl of experience: It can be difficult to discuss departmental policy concerning inappropriate IOCs with a surgeon while the patient is under anesthesiaIf inappropriate (but not harmful) requests are a recurring problem, departmental and institutional policies should be developed by surgeons and pathologists and discussed in a multidisciplinary settingIOCs known to have low sensitivity or specificityThe value of performing a frozen section may be very low in some situationsEvaluation of follicular thyroid lesions for capsular invasionEvaluation of margins of large breast excisionsThe surgeon should be aware of the likelihood of a change in diagnosis on permanent sectionsDepartmental and institutional policies should be developed for evaluating these types of specimensPATIENT HISTORYPrior to Intraoperative ConsultationKnowledge about the clinical setting helps establish a safety net for the patientA substantial number of errors occur because the pathologist interprets a specimen without adequate informationEspecially helpful in some situationsBiopsies of mediastinal lymph nodes (important to know if for tumor staging or to evaluate lymphadenopathy)Determines if the entire specimen should be frozen or only a representative portionResections after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapyChanges in normal cells due to treatment can be mistaken for malignancyRare tumor typesTumors for which imaging appearance is critical for final diagnosis (central nervous system tumors, bone tumors)Pearl of experience: Reviewing clinical histories prior to IOC leads to faster and more confident diagnoses and considerably less anxietySome people believe that pathologists should be able to divine all clinical information from surgical specimens as the haruspices in ancient Rome were able to divine information from examining organs; this is not trueIOC requiring the allocation of tissue for purposes beyond diagnosis must be identifiedTissue required for patient treatment should be distinguished from tissue requested for researchPatients may require tissue sampling to be eligible for clinical trialsSpecial procedures may be requiredSterile tissue is necessary for cell cultures (e.g., vaccine studies)Warm ischemia time (in operating room) and cold ischemia time (until tissue is frozen or placed in fixative should be minimized)Rapid freezing is required for the preservation of some unstable biomoleculesPatient care must always take precedence over use of tissue for research that does not directly impact patientObtaining information prior to IOC is preferable, when possibleDoes not extend the time of the IOC while the patient is under anesthesiaAllows time to review prior

an unusual case, and the best course of action is to contact the surgeonInformation obtained during IOCIf information is obtained from the surgeon that is helpful for the interpretation of the frozen section, this will also be helpful for the final diagnosisInformation should be recorded on the requisition form and available to the pathologist reviewing the case for final sign outInformation obtained in operating roomIn some institutions, it may be possible for the pathologist to directly observe the operative field and to discuss the case face-to-face with the surgeonREPORTING RESULTSWritten ReportThe diagnosis is written and signed by the attending pathologistMost laboratories have a specific form for this purposeThe form should be labeled with the patient name, medical record number, and surgical pathology numberThe specific specimen and subdesignation for the frozen section are includedThe diagnosis should directly address the question posed by the surgeon to successfully complete the operationPearl of experience: Diagnoses should be brief and include only the information necessary (e.g., \"no tumor present\" or \"metastatic cancer present\")Long and wordy reports are difficult to communicate orally and more likely to be misunderstoodAvoid using abbreviationsAn abbreviation saves time for 1 person and aggravates everyone elseAbbreviations may vary among specialties and may be misunderstoodFor example, pathologists understand \"c/w\" to mean \"consistent with,\" whereas radiologists understand \"c/w\" to mean \"compared with\"Superfluous information (typically histologic type or grade) is unnecessary and can create potential discrepancies with the final diagnosisPearl of experience: It is critical to know the consequences of a diagnosis (e.g., surgery for potential cure terminated or continued) when making diagnostic judgment calls when a definitive diagnosis is not obviousThe harm of a false-negative vs. a false-positive diagnosis for a patient is often not equivalentFalse-negative diagnoses are more common than false-positive diagnosesPathologists are generally conservative and require obvious features of malignancy before making a diagnosis on frozen sectionWritten reports of IOC as part of the final pathology report are typically not available to the patient's caregivers for daysWhen possible, documentation of the IOC in a manner that is available immediately in the patient's record is preferableIn electronic medical records, this may be possible using a hold note or as a report separate from the final pathology reportOral ReportThe final diagnosis is called back to the operating roomIt is preferable to read the written report exactlyIf not the surgeon, the person receiving the information should write it down and read the diagnosis back to the pathologistWhen possible, information should be relayed directly to the surgeonPearl of experience: Complex or unusual diagnoses are best communicated directly between the pathologist and surgeonThere is a high rate of miscommunication when the diagnosis is other than \"benign\" or \"malignant\"Reports that include terms indicating degrees of certainty (e.g., \"suspicious for,\" \"cannot exclude,\" \"atypical\") can be interpreted differently by the pathologist and surgeonSimilar terms (e.g., \"carcinoid\" and \"carcinoma\") must be clearly distinguishedTHE FUTUREEx Vivo MicroscopyNew techniques are able to derive microscopic detail from fresh tissueEx vivo microscopy is currently being used for IOC in some centersIt is possible that these techniques will be developed for in-vivo microscopy either in the operative field or via probes placed in tissuesArtificial IntelligenceMachine-learning computer programs are being used to analyze images for pathologic diagnosisArtificial intelligence (AI) could be used to assist pathologists for difficult cases &/or to provide services when a pathologist is not availableEither digitized images of glass slides or the images generated by ex vivo microscopy can be usedTelepathologyMany pathologists became more experienced with the use of telepathology for diagnosis during the COVID pandemicIt is likely telepathology will be used more widely in the future to broaden the number of pathologists who can provide IOC services",

        "raw_text": "INTRODUCTIONQuality AssessmentSuccessful rendering of an intraoperative consultation (IOC) requires a complex series of stepsEach institution needs to develop best practices for patient safety and care efficiencyThe Association of Directors of Anatomic and Surgical Pathology (ADASP) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) have issued recommendations for quality assurance (QA) and benchmarks for performanceELEMENTS OF QUALITY IMPROVEMENTQuality Improvement PlanMission statement: Clear statement of goalsIOCs offer patients the best care and minimize the possibility of errorMechanisms to detect errors are utilizedErrors are used as a means to educate practitioners and to improve the system to enhance accuracyAll elements of the test cycle are addressedPreanalytic, analytic, and postanalyticPriorities are set for targeting resources and efforts to best effectThe program complies with regulatory requirementsAppropriate internal and external benchmarks are utilizedUses data tracking to develop strategies for error reduction and preventionOperational Elements Contributing to High-Quality ServiceDiagnostic capability should be appropriate to the clinical settingAdequate expertise to handle institutional case complexityPeer consultation availabilitySubspecialist consultation &/or subspecialty call service if appropriateSufficient assigned pathologists to handle volumeAvailability of pathologist appropriate to clinical settingMay be provided at all times and every day in large hospitalsMay be prearranged by request for specific types of surgery in small community hospitals or surgicentersPhysical work environmentAdequate space, lighting, and ventilationTracking log to document receipt of all specimensWell-maintained cryostats and staining stationsWell-maintained microscopesPreferably with ability to share images with consultants, trainees, &/or clinicians via multiple heads, telepathology, or digital scanningProximity of special media, equipment (e.g., snap freezing), specimen containers, and requisition slips for ancillary studiesAvailability of printed and online resources for information related to IOCTelephone, intercoms, or other means to communicate with operating room staffClinical staffCompetent, accountable, and expeditious courier serviceTime spent in transferring specimens for IOC should be minimizedMedical/nursing staff provide accurate and sufficient information on requisition slipsInadequate information is detrimental for patient careIncreases likelihood of errors in sampling and interpretationMay delay diagnosis while additional information is soughtQUALITY ASSURANCE MONITORS AND REPORTINGVolume StatisticsMay be general or subcategorized by specimen typeRequired to determine quality indicators per specimenTurnaround TimeDefined as the time from delivery of specimen to IOC room to the time diagnosis is communicated to the surgeonThese times should be documented in a defined manner (e.g., in specimen tracking log, IOC report, separate QA database)Traditionally, the expected turnaround time (TAT) is < 20 minutes for a routine single-block specimen received by itself with no other concurrent specimens90% of IOCs can typically be performed during this length of timeCAP checklist no longer stipulates a threshold for accreditation purposesTAT perceived by the surgeon is the time that the specimen leaves the operating room to the time that he/she receives the diagnosisIt may be of value to monitor the transit time from the operating room to the IOC room (preanalytic variable)Case ReviewIOCs are periodically reviewedDiscrepant and deferred cases are detectedStatistics on performance are calculatedReport should be available &/or presented to departmentFollow-up on issues indicating system problems or need for peer review is part of the processADASP RecommendationAll IOCs should be reviewed on a regular basis and classified into the following categoriesAgreement (no discrepancy between intraoperative and final diagnosis)Disagreement: MinorDisagreement: MajorDeferral: AppropriateDeferral: InappropriateCases in \"Disagreement: Major\" and \"Deferral: Inappropriate\" categories should be further classified according to the source of the problem and to the severity of likely medical consequencesModifications of this schema have been proposed, e.g., defining minor vs. major errors solely in terms of risk for minor or major clinical significanceERRORSError Detection and ClassificationAll IOC diagnoses should be reviewed at the time of final diagnosis; in cases or potential discrepancy, the frozen section slides or IOC cytology preparations themselves should be reviewedIf the entire specimen was used for frozen section, the intraoperatively prepared frozen section slides should be reviewed for final diagnosisAny discordant findings should be investigated and reportedInterpretive error: Findings present on slides used for IOC but not reportedBlock sampling error: Findings not present on slides used for IOC but present in deeper levels on permanent sectionSome errors due to failure to sample the lesion are preventableRepresentative sections of all tissue fragments should be present on frozen section slidesExhaustive sampling of small specimens representing margins in cases with established primary tumor diagnosis may prevent false-negativesFailure to detect a lesion smaller than a tissue section (~ < 2-3 mm) will occur in some casesBecause it is impossible to detect all such minute lesions, it may not be appropriate to consider this an errorGross sampling error: Findings not present on slides used for IOC or on deeper levels but present in other sections of specimenIf a lesion is suspected preoperatively but not seen, additional sampling of the specimen is often of valueIn general, a lymph node being evaluated for IOC staging should be entirely frozen unless a grossly evident metastasis is presentIf a change in the IOC diagnosis will affect patient care, the surgeon should be notified immediately, and notification should be documented in the final pathology reportSuch notifications should be addressed by department policy regarding significant and unexpected findings in anatomic pathologySources of ErrorPreanalyticIncorrect case or patient identificationIncorrect site identification (e.g., proximal vs. distal resection margin)Inadequate clinical informationFailure to notify of prior diagnosis of malignancyFailure to provide information about prior therapyAdjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapyPurpose for IOC unclear or inappropriateAnalyticSamplingGross (lesion not selected for frozen section or cytologic preparation)Block (lesion present but not seen on prepared slides)TechnicalPoor freezing, cutting, or staining technique interferes with interpretationTissue lost during processingSlides mislabeledInterpretationChange in category (benign vs. malignant)Change within category (type of malignancy)Change in threshold (grade or stage)e.g., atypical ductal hyperplasia vs. ductal carcinoma in situ of breast, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia vs. adenocarcinoma in situ of lungChange in lymph node statusChange in margin statusPostanalyticThe diagnosis is not communicated to the surgeonAn incorrect diagnosis is communicated to the surgeonThe surgeon has an understanding of the reported diagnosis different from that of the pathologistClassification by ConsequencesADASP recommends classifying errors according to the severity of medical consequencesNo clinical significanceMinor or questionable clinical significanceMajor or potentially major clinical significanceSome QA systems classify according to actual rather than potential harmAt philosophical discretion of institution, but this should be defined in quality improvement planDEFERRED DIAGNOSESDefinitionIn a very broad sense, all IOC diagnoses are deferred to the final diagnosis on permanent sectionsFor QA purposes, the diagnosis is defined as deferred when no diagnosis can be renderedShould be reserved for cases in which information requested cannot be provided using the specimen providedTypically, < 5% of IOCs are deferred but may vary by specimen typee.g., deferrals are common for follicular lesions of the thyroidTypesThere are 5 major sources of deferred diagnosesDifficult to classify lesions: Definitive diagnosis (i.e., benign vs. malignant) may not be possible for some specimens submitted for IOCCommon examplesPancreatic adenocarcinoma vs. chronic pancreatitisLepidic pattern adenocarcinoma vs. reactive changes in lungResidual/recurrent squamous cell carcinoma vs. radiation-induced atypia in squamous metaplasiaDeferral is appropriate if sufficient diagnostic features are not presentThe number of appropriately deferred cases is a measure of the number of very difficult cases encountered in IOCDeferral is inappropriate if, on QA review of frozen section, diagnosis is deemed to be (reasonably) possibleThe number of inappropriately deferred cases is a measure of knowledge base/experience of pathologistsCorrective measure: Review diagnostic features with the pathologistProvide literature and online resources with diagnostic criteria that are readily accessible in the IOC roomConsider methods to facilitate 2nd opinions for difficult cases (e.g., telepathology)Biopsy-induced artifacts: Extensive crushing &/or cautery can cause tissue damage that precludes interpretationDeferral appropriate for severely damaged specimensNumber of deferred cases is a measure of surgical ability to provide high-quality specimensCorrective measure: Explore alternative methods (e.g., cutting needle vs. pinching forceps &/or excision without cautery for diagnostic biopsies submitted for IOC)Some tumors, notably small cell carcinoma, are friable and very difficult to biopsy without significant artifactArtifacts or tissue loss due to pathology processing: Poor selection of tissue (e.g., freezing large fatty fragments &/or wet tissue), poor cutting technique (e.g., thick, wrinkled sections), poor staining (e.g., contamination of stains with xylene), and loss of tissue in cryostat may preclude interpretationWhen feasible and appropriate, additional tissue should be frozen or an additional biopsy should be requested from surgeonDeferral is not appropriate if a better technique would have yielded an interpretable slideThe number of deferred cases is a measure of the capacity of pathology personnel to produce high-quality slidesCorrective measure: Review appropriate preparation of frozen sections slides with pathology personnelSpecimens not amenable to frozen section or cytologic examination: It may not be possible to evaluate fatty tissue or heavily calcified specimens, such as boneDeferral is appropriate if tissue cannot be examinedThe number of deferred cases is a measure of the number of cases that are submitted for IOC that cannot be examinedCorrective measure: Surgeons can be informed about types of specimens that cannot be evaluated by IOCRemember that some specimens not amenable to cryostat sectioning can be interpreted using intraoperative cytology preparationsLack of sufficient clinical information for evaluation: In some cases, clinical information is essential to provide diagnosisCommon examplesBrain and bone lesion evaluation requires information about imaging findingsInformation about prior radiation or chemotherapy is necessary to determine if cells with atypia are more likely malignant or due to treatment-induced changesThyroid follicles associated with lymphocytes and germinal centers could be metastatic carcinoma to a lymph node or an area of nodular lymphocytic thyroiditis, depending on history of malignancy and location of noduleDeferral is appropriate if information cannot or is not provided by the surgeon or is unavailable in the system (e.g., electronic medical record)The number of deferred cases is a measure of cases without essential clinical informationCorrective measure: Surgeons are informed of information needed by the pathologist for IOCReview of hospital &/or laboratory information system for patients with scheduled operations likely to generate IOC can be helpfulCases Not Considered DeferredIn some situations, definitive diagnosis is not provided, but the case should not be considered deferred for QA purposesProvisional diagnosis: In many cases, it is appropriate to provide some diagnostic information on IOC, but the final diagnosis is best made after evaluation of permanent sections and possible ancillary studiesCommon examplesSpindle cell neoplasmLymphoproliferative disorderEncapsulated follicular neoplasm of thyroidLesional tissue presentThe goal of IOC is to provide optimum intraprocedural patient and specimen management; in this pursuit, a correct but less specific diagnosis is better than an incorrect but more specific diagnosis, i.e., \"diagnostic minimalism\" is appropriateThe number of such cases should not be used as a measure of quality of IOCCanceled diagnosis: In some cases, IOC may be requested that is considered inappropriate or unnecessary by the pathologistPathologist should discuss the case with the surgeon to come to a decision to cancel requestThis should be considered a canceled request and not a deferred diagnosisBENCHMARKSStudies of General AccuracyOverall accuracy generally in 90-98% range across specimen types in large studiesFalse-negatives are much more frequent (~ 7x) than false-positivesSampling error is more common than interpretive errorAccuracy is generally higher for more narrowly defined (e.g., margin assessment of known malignancy) than general (\"what is this mass\") questionsADASP BenchmarksRecommendations for maximum acceptable ratesDisagreement: Major cases = 3%Deferral: Inappropriate cases = 10%Variables Affecting AccuracyIncidence of target lesion in populationIf true positives are rare, even studies with low sensitivity may have high negative predictive valueReason for IOCDefined question, such as margin positivity of known cancer type, may yield accuracy approaching 100%Accuracy of primary diagnosis of unknown tumor type is closer to 80%Inclusion or exclusion of lesions is difficult to diagnose on frozen sectionNoninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear featuresPaget disease of vulvaSkin margins for melanomaPrimary diagnosis of Hirschsprung diseaseInclusion or exclusion of small lesions is difficult or impossible to reliably detect by frozen sectionMicropapillary carcinoma of thyroidMicrometastases or isolated tumor cells in sentinel nodes for breast cancerInclusion or exclusion of deferred casesDefinition of \"deferred\" diagnosis variesExclusion of these cases reduces total number of cases and, therefore, increases error rateSite-Specific AccuracyAccuracy is variable according to the types of cases includedFor specialty hospitals and centers of excellence, it may be appropriate to set specimen-specific benchmarks for reportingPositive/negative predictive value of IOC by specimen type often has more clinical utility than sensitivity/specificity/accuracy, e.g., SLN sampling in breast cancerSTRATEGIES TO PREVENT ERRORClinical InformationPreoperative conferences for complex cases heavily reliant on clinical or imaging information (e.g., orthopedic tumors) are very usefulEnsure surgeons are aware of information that can alter IOC interpretationUtilize medical records, when possible, to obtain essential information prior to IOCRequest additional information from the surgeon if the reason for IOC is unclear or if unusual findings are encounteredPatient IdentificationUse of 2 identifiers on specimen and slide labelsRead back of patient identification by operating room team [Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) requirement]Accession case with laboratory ID number as early as possible in handling processAll paperwork, slides, and specimen containers must be labeledSamplingCareful gross examination and sectioning of mass lesions are essentialAdditional sampling of gross specimen or block is appropriate when only limited lesion is present for evaluation on slideBeware of secondary processes, such as scar, abscess, and granulomataSampling from edge of malignancy may only reveal reactive changesExamples of site-specific strategies to improve samplingAdditional gross or microscopic sectioning of lung granulomas and scarsAdditional sampling of large ovarian/adnexal masses, particularly mucinous tumorsIf malignancy is not seen on initial sections, attending pathologist should reexamine gross specimenComplete exhaustion of negative tissue margins in skin excisionsSubmission by surgeon of en face margins distinct from resection specimen for complex anatomic specimens (e.g., pancreatic duct margin, head and neck mucosal excisions)If the diagnosis is not possible, request additional samples from the surgeon if feasible or defer the diagnosis if notInterpretationCases appropriate for IOC should be determined by institutionInappropriate requests can be harmful to patients and may be more prone to errore.g., small primary lesions should not be completely frozen for diagnosisPreview of scheduled cases, including review of any available prior slides for comparison, is helpfulUse cytology preparations as adjunct to conventional frozen sectionsUse of differential diagnosis lists; a diagnosis not considered cannot be madeHave relevant resources with information about IOC readily availableConsideration of metastatic disease, particularly in \"sump\" organs (lung, liver, brain)Pathologist should be aware of clinical consequence of diagnosisIn some cases, a false-negative diagnosis may cause less patient harm than a false-positive diagnosisCommunication about the degree of diagnosis certainty may be helpful to the surgeonFalse-negative diagnoses are more common than false-positive diagnosesPathologists tend to be conservativeSpecific criteria for malignancy can be helpful (e.g., for pancreatic carcinoma)Obtain 2nd opinion, when possible, on site or via telepathologyGeneral \"2nd eye\" or use of pathologist \"hospitalist\" who specializes in intraprocedural evaluationSubspecialist expertiseMay be ad hoc or institutional policy for certain case types, e.g., brain tumors, donor organs for transplantationTechnical FactorsMake sure cryostats are working at the beginning of the day by cutting the test slideEnsure all personnel using cryostats and stain lines are adequately trainedDo not hesitate to cut additional sections if tissue folds or holes make interpretation difficultCommunicationReporting diagnoses by telephone or intercom should follow recommended proceduresConfirm patient identityIdentify the pathologist rendering the diagnosisIdentify the operating room team member receiving the reportState the findings in the clearest terms possible; engage the surgeon in discussion or have a member of the surgical team acknowledge any ambiguous findingsAvoid unnecessarily wordy diagnostic textBe aware that qualifiers, such as \"favor\" or \"suspicious,\" may be (are often) misunderstoodUncertain (often deferred) diagnoses are more frequently misunderstood than benign or malignantSimilar terms may be confused (especially carcinoma vs. carcinoid)Read back of the diagnosis by operating teamThe pathologist must listen to confirm the correct understandingRequired by The Joint Commission (TJC) (formerly, JCAHO)Standard DC.01.02.01: \"Before taking action on a verbal order or verbal report of a test result, staff uses a record and 'read back' process to verify the information\"Direct discussion between the pathologist and surgeon may be preferable in some casesNuanced or complex diagnosesUnclear indication for IOCElicitation of additional significant historyRecording diagnosesA written record of IOC should be incorporated in the final diagnostic reportInclude the pathologist(s) issuing the diagnosisInclude the clinician who was informed of the diagnosisPathology information should includeThe diagnosis as reported to the clinical staffQualifying comments as

          "DEFERRED DIAGNOSES": "DefinitionIn a very broad sense, all IOC diagnoses are deferred to the final diagnosis on permanent sectionsFor QA purposes, the diagnosis is defined as deferred when no diagnosis can be renderedShould be reserved for cases in which information requested cannot be provided using the specimen providedTypically, < 5% of IOCs are deferred but may vary by specimen typee.g., deferrals are common for follicular lesions of the thyroidTypesThere are 5 major sources of deferred diagnosesDifficult to classify lesions: Definitive diagnosis (i.e., benign vs. malignant) may not be possible for some specimens submitted for IOCCommon examplesPancreatic adenocarcinoma vs. chronic pancreatitisLepidic pattern adenocarcinoma vs. reactive changes in lungResidual/recurrent squamous cell carcinoma vs. radiation-induced atypia in squamous metaplasiaDeferral is appropriate if sufficient diagnostic features are not presentThe number of appropriately deferred cases is a measure of the number of very difficult cases encountered in IOCDeferral is inappropriate if, on QA review of frozen section, diagnosis is deemed to be (reasonably) possibleThe number of inappropriately deferred cases is a measure of knowledge base/experience of pathologistsCorrective measure: Review diagnostic features with the pathologistProvide literature and online resources with diagnostic criteria that are readily accessible in the IOC roomConsider methods to facilitate 2nd opinions for difficult cases (e.g., telepathology)Biopsy-induced artifacts: Extensive crushing &/or cautery can cause tissue damage that precludes interpretationDeferral appropriate for severely damaged specimensNumber of deferred cases is a measure of surgical ability to provide high-quality specimensCorrective measure: Explore alternative methods (e.g., cutting needle vs. pinching forceps &/or excision without cautery for diagnostic biopsies submitted for IOC)Some tumors, notably small cell carcinoma, are friable and very difficult to biopsy without significant artifactArtifacts or tissue loss due to pathology processing: Poor selection of tissue (e.g., freezing large fatty fragments &/or wet tissue), poor cutting technique (e.g., thick, wrinkled sections), poor staining (e.g., contamination of stains with xylene), and loss of tissue in cryostat may preclude interpretationWhen feasible and appropriate, additional tissue should be frozen or an additional biopsy should be requested from surgeonDeferral is not appropriate if a better technique would have yielded an interpretable slideThe number of deferred cases is a measure of the capacity of pathology personnel to produce high-quality slidesCorrective measure: Review appropriate preparation of frozen sections slides with pathology personnelSpecimens not amenable to frozen section or cytologic examination: It may not be possible to evaluate fatty tissue or heavily calcified specimens, such as boneDeferral is appropriate if tissue cannot be examinedThe number of deferred cases is a measure of the number of cases that are submitted for IOC that cannot be examinedCorrective measure: Surgeons can be informed about types of specimens that cannot be evaluated by IOCRemember that some specimens not amenable to cryostat sectioning can be interpreted using intraoperative cytology preparationsLack of sufficient clinical information for evaluation: In some cases, clinical information is essential to provide diagnosisCommon examplesBrain and bone lesion evaluation requires information about imaging findingsInformation about prior radiation or chemotherapy is necessary to determine if cells with atypia are more likely malignant or due to treatment-induced changesThyroid follicles associated with lymphocytes and germinal centers could be metastatic carcinoma to a lymph node or an area of nodular lymphocytic thyroiditis, depending on history of malignancy and location of noduleDeferral is appropriate if information cannot or is not provided by the surgeon or is unavailable in the system (e.g., electronic medical record)The number of deferred cases is a measure of cases without essential clinical informationCorrective measure: Surgeons are informed of information needed by the pathologist for IOCReview of hospital &/or laboratory information system for patients with scheduled operations likely to generate IOC can be helpfulCases Not Considered DeferredIn some situations, definitive diagnosis is not provided, but the case should not be considered deferred for QA purposesProvisional diagnosis: In many cases, it is appropriate to provide some diagnostic information on IOC, but the final diagnosis is best made after evaluation of permanent sections and possible ancillary studiesCommon examplesSpindle cell neoplasmLymphoproliferative disorderEncapsulated follicular neoplasm of thyroidLesional tissue presentThe goal of IOC is to provide optimum intraprocedural patient and specimen management; in this pursuit, a correct but less specific diagnosis is better than an incorrect but more specific diagnosis, i.e., \"diagnostic minimalism\" is appropriateThe number of such cases should not be used as a measure of quality of IOCCanceled diagnosis: In some cases, IOC may be requested that is considered inappropriate or unnecessary by the pathologistPathologist should discuss the case with the surgeon to come to a decision to cancel requestThis should be considered a canceled request and not a deferred diagnosisBENCHMARKSStudies of General AccuracyOverall accuracy generally in 90-98% range across specimen types in large studiesFalse-negatives are much more frequent (~ 7x) than false-positivesSampling error is more common than interpretive errorAccuracy is generally higher for more narrowly defined (e.g., margin assessment of known malignancy) than general (\"what is this mass\") questionsADASP BenchmarksRecommendations for maximum acceptable ratesDisagreement: Major cases = 3%Deferral: Inappropriate cases = 10%Variables Affecting Accuracy\nIncidence of target lesion in populationIf true positives are rare, even studies with low sensitivity may have high negative predictive valueReason for IOCDefined question, such as margin positivity of known cancer type, may yield accuracy approaching 100%Accuracy of primary diagnosis of unknown tumor type is closer to 80%Inclusion or exclusion of lesions is difficult to diagnose on frozen sectionNoninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear featuresPaget disease of vulvaSkin margins for melanomaPrimary diagnosis of Hirschsprung diseaseInclusion or exclusion of small lesions is difficult or impossible to reliably detect by frozen sectionMicropapillary carcinoma of thyroidMicrometastases or isolated tumor cells in sentinel nodes for breast cancerInclusion or exclusion of deferred casesDefinition of \"deferred\" diagnosis variesExclusion of these cases reduces total number of cases and, therefore, increases error rateSite-Specific AccuracyAccuracy is variable according to the types of cases includedFor specialty hospitals and centers of excellence, it may be appropriate to set specimen-specific benchmarks for reportingPositive/negative predictive value of IOC by specimen type often has more clinical utility than sensitivity/specificity/accuracy, e.g., SLN sampling in breast cancerSTRATEGIES TO PREVENT ERRORClinical InformationPreoperative conferences for complex cases heavily reliant on clinical or imaging information (e.g., orthopedic tumors) are very usefulEnsure surgeons are aware of information that can alter IOC interpretationUtilize medical records, when possible, to obtain essential information prior to IOCRequest additional information from the surgeon if the reason for IOC is unclear or if unusual findings are encounteredPatient IdentificationUse of 2 identifiers on specimen and slide labelsRead back of patient identification by operating room team [Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) requirement]Accession case with laboratory ID number as early as possible in handling processAll paperwork, slides, and specimen containers must be labeledSamplingCareful gross examination and sectioning of mass lesions are essentialAdditional sampling of gross specimen or block is appropriate when only limited lesion is present for evaluation on slideBeware of secondary processes, such as scar, abscess, and granulomataSampling from edge of malignancy may only reveal reactive changesExamples of site-specific strategies to improve samplingAdditional gross or microscopic sectioning of lung granulomas and scarsAdditional sampling of large ovarian/adnexal masses, particularly mucinous tumorsIf malignancy is not seen on initial sections, attending pathologist should reexamine gross specimenComplete exhaustion of negative tissue margins in skin excisionsSubmission by surgeon of en face margins distinct from resection specimen for complex anatomic specimens (e.g., pancreatic duct margin, head and neck mucosal excisions)If the diagnosis is not possible, request additional samples from the surgeon if feasible or defer the diagnosis if notInterpretationCases appropriate for IOC should be determined by institutionInappropriate requests can be harmful to patients and may be more prone to errore.g., small primary lesions should not be completely frozen for diagnosisPreview of scheduled cases, including review of any available prior slides for comparison, is helpfulUse cytology preparations as adjunct to conventional frozen sectionsUse of differential diagnosis lists; a diagnosis not considered cannot be madeHave relevant resources with information about IOC readily availableConsideration of metastatic disease, particularly in \"sump\" organs (lung, liver, brain)Pathologist should be aware of clinical consequence of diagnosisIn some cases, a false-negative diagnosis may cause less patient harm than a false-positive diagnosisCommunication about the degree of diagnosis certainty may be helpful to the surgeonFalse-negative diagnoses are more common than false-positive diagnosesPathologists tend to be conservativeSpecific criteria for malignancy can be helpful (e.g., for pancreatic carcinoma)Obtain 2nd opinion, when possible, on site or via telepathologyGeneral \"2nd eye\" or use of pathologist \"hospitalist\" who specializes in intraprocedural evaluationSubspecialist expertiseMay be ad hoc or institutional policy for certain case types, e.g., brain tumors, donor organs for transplantationTechnical FactorsMake sure cryostats are working at the beginning of the day by cutting the test slideEnsure all personnel using cryostats and stain lines are adequately trainedDo not hesitate to cut additional sections if tissue folds or holes make interpretation difficultCommunicationReporting diagnoses by telephone or intercom should follow recommended proceduresConfirm patient identityIdentify the pathologist rendering the diagnosisIdentify the operating room team member receiving the reportState the findings in the clearest terms possible; engage the surgeon in discussion or have a member of the surgical team acknowledge any ambiguous findingsAvoid unnecessarily wordy diagnostic textBe aware that qualifiers, such as \"favor\" or \"suspicious,\" may be (are often) misunderstoodUncertain (often deferred) diagnoses are more frequently misunderstood than benign or malignantSimilar terms may be confused (especially carcinoma vs. carcinoid)Read back of the diagnosis by operating teamThe pathologist must listen to confirm the correct understandingRequired by The Joint Commission (TJC) (formerly, JCAHO)Standard DC.01.02.01: \"Before taking action on a verbal order or verbal report of a test result, staff uses a record and 'read back' process to verify the information\"Direct discussion between the pathologist and surgeon may be preferable in some casesNuanced or complex diagnosesUnclear indication for IOCElicitation of additional significant historyRecording diagnosesA written record of IOC should be incorporated in the final diagnostic reportInclude the pathologist(s) issuing the diagnosisInclude the clinician who was informed of the diagnosisPathology information should includeThe diagnosis as reported to the clinical staffQualifying comments as reported to the clinical staffA description of the gross specimen received, particularly if changed by IOCCollapse of cystic structureDocumentation of tissue submitted for special diagnostic or research studies or tissue bankingOrientation informationInk &/or slide key, as appropriateTOOLS TO IMPROVE PERSONAL PERFORMANCEQuality Assurance DashboardDashboard refers to easily accessible user-friendly set of tools and informationCan be used to compare individual pathologist performance against departmental or national benchmarksUseful for direct feedback to the pathologist on overall performance as well as for credentialing or peer review, using objective dataRoot Cause Analysis of ErrorsErrors should be discussed with the pathologist(s) involvedUseful for analysis of variables leading to error and feedback about specific case issuesMajor errors resulting in changes in patient care due to lapses in knowledge may require focused retrainingMinor errors not resulting in changes in patient care should also be reviewed to keep the pathologist aware of discrepanciesIntraoperative Consultation ConferenceHighly useful for sharing common challenges for complex or problematic cases through vicarious learningAll errors are opportunities for learningIn some cases, it may be appropriate to not identify the pathologist involvedIn other cases, it may be appropriate to have the pathologist present the case"

        "raw_text": "INTRODUCTIONFactors Predisposing to InjuryThe risk to personnel in the intraoperative consultation (IOC) room is greater than the risk to pathology personnel in general due to multiple factorsTime constraintsActivities (e.g., examining specimens, cutting sections) need to be performed quicklyMultiple people from different departments use the IOC roomPathology personnel, surgeons, operating room nurses, and researchers may be presentNot all people may be familiar with best practices for the room and specimensMultiple people may be involved in examining a single specimenEach person must be responsible for appropriate and careful handling and disposal of sharpsUnfamiliarity with room &/or equipmentSome personnel may only use the room intermittentlySafety equipment may not always be used appropriatelyMaterials may not be replaced or replenished appropriatelyThe room may be used at night and on weekends when personnel familiar with the workspace are not presentLess experienced personnel may perform tasks at irregular intervalsMay only use cryostat during IOCsPatients undergoing surgery may have undiagnosed infectious diseaseExposure may occur due to penetrating trauma, inhalation, or mucocutaneous exposureMajority of specimens harboring infectious organisms do not pose risk to people who are not immunocompromisedPathology personnel who are immunocompromised or with compromised skin (dermatitis, weeping skin lesions, or wounds) may have increased vulnerabilityIt is important to have protocols and personnel in place to ensure safety1 person should be designated as being in charge of IOC roomEnsures the room is properly equipped and maintainedProvides training to new personnelSupervises daily use of the roomNew pathology personnel should be trained in appropriate procedures during IOCTraining should occur annually or when a new procedure is introducedTRAUMATIC INJURIESSourcesRazor bladesShould have a single blade and always be used with protective sheathCryostat bladesBlades should never be cleaned with handsA large swab (e.g., gauze wrapped around an applicator) is a safer method to brush shavings away from the bladeInjuries from cryostat blades are particularly problematic as exposure to multiple specimens is possibleIf a chuck or block needs to be manipulated, this should be done outside of cryostatRemoval of excess embedding materialRemoval of staples from tissueScalpelsBlades must be removed with caution using hemostat or forcepsA common source of injuries is during removal of the blade when it is contaminatedLarge cutting bladesDisposable blades are preferredCan be disposed rather than cleanedDo not require sharpeningSyringe needlesThe use of needles is rarely indicated and should be avoided due to the risk of penetrating injuriesIf used, the needle should be directly discarded into a sharps container and not recappedNeedles should not be used to mark the site of the lesion for later evaluationLarge paperclips can be threaded through tissue to mark lesions (e.g., the site where a radioactive seed was removed)If multiple lesions are present, paperclips of different colors can be usedTypes of InjuriesThe most common type of injury is a laceration from a bladeNondominant hand injuries are most common but also occur to the dominant handInjuries can potentially convey infectious agentsHepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, and TBThere are 2 cases of tumors being transferred to a healthcare worker via accidental injury1 due to scalpel injury during surgery and 1 due to needle stick in research laboratoryPreventionAll blades must be discarded by the person using the bladeA common source of injury is from blades hidden by surgical drapes, paper towels, or tissueBlades should be discarded rather than left on the workspace surface after useThe hand holding the specimen should be well away from the hand holding the bladeHard specimens that require increased force to section are particularly hazardousThe specimen can be held with gauze, which provides a firmer grip and helps keep the nondominant hand away from the bladeKevlar gloves or metal mesh gloves are availableIn actual practice, these gloves are unwieldy and difficult to useUse of needles and other piercing instruments should be avoidedFrozen embedding medium should not be removed from the chuck using a bladeCommon source of injuryThe chuck can be kept at room temperature until the block is melted or the chuck and block can be briefly dipped into a formalin container to speed meltingCytologic preparations should be used rather than frozen sections when infection is suspectedWhen possible, it is helpful to use a single dedicated cryostat for infectious casesINHALATIONSourcesTissue from patients with infectious diseaseCoworkers can also pose a hazard during a pandemic with a respiratory virus, such as COVID-19Masks should be worn according to institutional practicesChemicals (stains, fixatives)Formaldehyde and xylene are of most concernAfter initial levels are shown to be low, subsequent monitoring of room is not required unless there is concern for exposureMechanism of InjuryInfectionOnly reported when aerosolized coolants have been used to freeze blocks with tissue containing Mycobacterium tuberculosisCoolants should not be sprayed directly onto tissueIf used to cool a block, resulting aerosol should be contained within cryostat and not inhaledBetter alternative methods for cooling blocks rapidly are availableSpecimens are unlikely to pose a threat under other conditionsChemical inhalationUnlikely to occur unless chemicals are not stored properly or unless there is a large spillPreventionInfectionMasks designed to protect from aerosolized bacteria are availableSpecific masks for protection from M. tuberculosis should be used when specimens from patients with known infections are examinedChemical inhalationAppropriate ventilation of IOC room is essentialChemicals must be

or specimens of known or suspected infectious riskExtreme care should be exercised when cutting into a hard, intact mass that could be cysticPiercing cyst can result in forceful ejection of fluid for several feetA waterproof barrier may be kept over the site of incision until it is determined if fluid is present or notCysts should be opened near a sink to aid in the disposal of fluid cyst contentsEating, drinking, smoking, and application of cosmetics or lip balm are not allowed in the IOC roomFood cannot be stored in the room or refrigerators and must not be discarded in waste containersMaterial that will leave the IOC room must be clean to protect personnel outside the room from exposuresOuter specimen container is kept cleanAll paperwork is kept cleanIf contamination occurs, paperwork can be placed inside protective plastic sleeve or information copied onto clean formINFECTIOUS AGENTSGeneral GuidelinesFreezing does not inactivate infectious agentsFormalin inactivates many infectious agents but may require many hours to do soPrions remain infective after routine fixationIOCs should only be performed when absolutely necessary on specimens suspected to harbor an infectious agentHowever, the majority of infectious agents do not pose risks to immunocompetent individualsOnly 3 reported cases of transmission of infectious agent during IOC (all M. tuberculosis)Tuberculosis3 cases of conversion to positive skin tests have been reported during performance of frozen sectionAll involved use of aerosolized coolant and inhalationAerosols should be avoidedYearly TB tests are recommended for all hospital personnelCreutzfeldt-Jakob Disease3 technicians working in laboratories studying Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) have died of this disease1 technician had a known penetrating injury from a forceps after handling frozen tissueThe other 2 technicians did not have a specific injury documentedNo cases have been reported during performance of IOCSpecial techniques are necessary to inactivate prion proteinsFormalin fixation for 24 hours95% formic acid for 1 hourFormalin fixation for another 24 hoursSymptoms suggestive of CJD includeRapidly progressive dementiaMyoclonusNonspecific neurologic findingsTissue handlingSpecimens from patients with suspected CJD should not be examined by IOCTissue should be fixed immediately following recommended protocols and stored in a secure locationThe clinical necessity of tissue processing should be considered carefully before placing personnel at riskHIVNo cases have been reported during performance of IOC1 reported case of a pathologist infected after scalpel injury to hand during performance of autopsy~ 0.3% risk of infection after penetrating injuryPostexposure prophylaxis includes 4-week treatment with 2 drugsHepatitis B VirusNo cases have been reported during performance of IOC~ 30% risk of infection after percutaneous penetrating injuryLikely also high risk after mucocutaneous exposureInfectious hepatitis B virus (HBV) can exist in dried blood for at least 1 weekPathology personnel should be vaccinated for hepatitis BIf nonvaccinated person is exposed, postexposure prophylaxis includes vaccination for HBVHepatitis B immune globulin can also be usedHepatitis C VirusNo cases have been reported during performance of IOC~ 0.2% risk of exposure after penetrating injuryRisk after mucocutaneous exposure is likely lowDegrades rapidly in environmentPersonnel should be monitored for infection after exposurePostexposure prophylaxis has not been shown to be effectiveTUMORSRisk After ExposureThere are 2 reports of tumors being transferred to another individual after accidental exposureA sarcoma was transferred via a hand injury to a surgeonGenetic analysis showed that tumor was derived from patientThe tumor was excised, and the physician remained well 2 years laterA colonic adenocarcinoma cell line was transferred to a laboratory worker via a needle injuryThe carcinoma was excised, and the worker remained well 4 years laterProcedures to avoid exposure to infectious agents also prevent exposure to tumorsRisk of transferring tumor to another person is extremely lowRADIATIONSpecimensRadioactive agents are sometimes used intraoperativelySentinel lymph node identificationRadioactive seeds for localization of breast lesionsOctreotide to localize neuroendocrine lesionsThe dose used is generally too low to result in significant exposure to pathology personnelSpecial procedures are generally not required to limit exposureStandard gloves are adequate for protectionRadioactive seeds contain I-125 that emits low-energy gamma rays of 20-30 keVTitanium capsule surrounds internal core filament containing I-125If internal core filament is damaged, the area must be treated as a radioactive spillDamaging the seed should be avoided by not using scissors and very carefully sectioning the specimen with a scalpel under guidance with gamma probeNo injuries have been reportedAdequate storage area is required for retrieved radioactive materialRadioactive seeds can be safely stored in a metal containerThe seed must be stored in a closed container listing the corresponding surgical pathology numberLog book is required to document the specific seed, when it is retrieved from the specimen, and when it is released to the Radiation Safety DepartmentPreventionIf radioactive agents are used during surgery, risk to pathology personnel should be consideredIf radioactive materials need to be retrieved (e.g., radioactive seeds), procedures for doing so must be institutedPathologists must have necessary equipment (e.g., Geiger counter, gamma probe) to monitor radioactive material and to detect radioactive medical devicesPERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENTGeneral GuidelinesPPE is defined as equipment designed to prevent exposure of skin or clothing to blood or other infectious materialsWorn to minimize exposure to hazards that cause serious workplace injuries and illnessesIncludes chemical, radiologic, physical, electrical, mechanical, or other workplace hazardsMust be provided by institution to employeesMust be discarded appropriately when contaminated and when leaving the IOC roomHandsGloves must always be worn when handling tissuesRings with sharp surfaces should be removed as they can increase the likelihood of puncture2 pairs of gloves are recommended if infectious agent is suspectedLatex gloves protect against biohazards but not chemicalsLatex is permeable to chemicals and can rapidly degrade when exposed to some typesNitrile and neoprene gloves protect against biohazards and exposure to fixativesPersonnel with latex allergy may use nitrile glovesMetal mesh and Kevlar cloth gloves are available if puncture injuries are possibleLatex or nitrile gloves are worn beneath and over glovesSoiled gloves should be discarded and replaced when touching other objects in roomGloves should also be changed between specimens to avoid any chance of contamination\"Clean\" areas should be established in which gloves are not wornHands must always be washed after handling specimens and when leaving IOC roomSmall, inapparent breaks in gloves are commonIf 2 gloves are worn and blood is present between gloves, gloves should immediately be removed to determine the source of bloodIf a hand injury is identified, first aid and evaluation of infection exposure is requiredGloves should not be worn when touching items used by people who do not wear glovesTelephones, computers, pagers, microscopes, paperwork, other areas designated as \"clean\" areasThese items should be kept clean and only handled with clean, bare handsHead and FaceEye protection should be worn if splash injuries are possibleSafety glasses or gogglesFull face maskFace protection should include side shieldsSpecial respiratory masks protect against aerosolized TBN-95 masks filter at least 95% of particulates that are 3 μm or largerRequires each person to be individually fitted for maskIn practice, these masks are uncomfortable and not often usedSurgical masksDesigned to protect patients from exhalations of person wearing maskInadequate to protect pathology personnel from aerosolized infectious agentsCan provide protection of mouth and lower face from splashesSurgical capsGenerally not requiredBodyScrub suits may be worn when exposure is probableThese clothes can be easily exchanged for clean replacements if exposure occursAprons are used over clothes or scrub suits to protect torsoSleeve protectors or aprons with sleeves are preferable when numerous specimens are handledDisposable jumpsuits offer complete coverage of bodyLab coats should not be used for protection if also worn outside of the IOC roomShoe covers are generally not necessaryEQUIPMENT AND ROOMCryostatIdeally, 1 cryostat should be designated for known or possible infectious casesCases requiring decontamination include known or suspected HIV, HBV, HCV, respiratory viruses, prion disease, mycobacterial disease, or systemic fungal diseaseAfter cryostat is used for such cases, it must be marked and not used again until after decontaminationAll cryostats must be decontaminated at defined intervalsCryostat is defrostedTuberculocidal disinfectant is used to clean interiorTrimmings and sections of tissues must be removedCollege of American Pathologists (CAP) laboratory accreditation program requires documented procedure for decontamination at defined intervalsMore frequent decontamination is necessary if known infectious cases have been processedRoom\"Clean\" areas should be designated where gloves must not be wornTypically microscopes, telephones, door knobsMost common items used by personnel are not directly involved in processing specimensOnly clean hands without gloves are allowed to handle material in these areasAvoids possible contamination with biohazardous material that has touched glovesAll soiled disposable material should be immediately placed in appropriate biohazard containersExposed surfaces are cleaned and disinfected with diluted bleach or other appropriate sterilantsSpecimensFixed in adequate amount of formalin as soon as possibleContainer must be leakproof and securely sealedSpecimens that may be infected with CJD must be specifically labeled as

and doors kept closedSafety EquipmentRemoval of scalpel handlesInjuries may occur when removing the blade from the handleBlades should not be removed using handsForceps or hemostats can be usedThe handle is held firmlyThe blade is pointed away from prosector and other peopleThe blade and blade lock must be facing upward with the slanted edge of the blade facing toward the prosectorThe base of the blade is grasped with forceps or hemostat and pulled outward away from the handle until the blade lock hole lifts off the lockThe blade is then carefully moved forward (toward tip) to removeThe blade is then placed in a sharps containerSpecial devices can also be used to remove handlesSome are attached to sharps disposal containersSharps containersUsed to dispose of all blades and needlesMust be red &/or marked with biohazard signLeakproofHave capacity to be closedShould be emptied frequently so that sharps can be dropped into the containerSharps should never be pushed into the

        "raw_text": "INTRODUCTIONDefinitionCollege of American Pathologists (CAP) definition: \"The practice of pathology in which digitized or analog video or still images are viewed and the interpretation is part of a formal diagnostic report or the patient record\"In general, traditional glass slides are viewed remotelyIn newer systems, ex vivo digital images can be evaluated using telepathologyAdvantages of Telepathology for Intraoperative ConsultationInterpretation can be provided from multiple locationsPathologists can be far from the intraoperative consultation (IOC) roomEasier availability outside working hoursGreater access to underserved or remote locationsEasier access to multiple opinions or subspecialty expertiseSome cases are very difficult and benefit from multiple reviewersUnusual tumors or tumors post neoadjuvant therapySubtle judgments of invasion or margin status, particularly in cases in which there is extensive cautery or crush artifactPathology practice is increasingly subspecializedMaintaining subspecialist availability 24 hours/day, 7 days/week for IOC is logistical challenge for all pathology groups, including large academic departmentsIn some healthcare systems, hospitals with specialized clinical centers of excellence may require more intense subspecialty pathology support than can be provided on siteEfficiency in staffingMismatch of case volume and need for on-site presence can be alleviated through case flow, not limited by proximity to slide productionIn large networks or multihospital systems, telepathology (for both IOC and permanent section consultation) allows for more efficient use of pathologist resourcesCreates opportunities for smaller pathology groups to work cooperatively for IOC or expertise sharingAccess to prior pathologyIn institutions with digital archives, images of patients' prior pathology specimens may be accessible for real-time comparison to frozen section findingsReview of prior tumor histology can be critical for interpretation of intraoperative findings, especially after neoadjuvant treatmentAvailability of images to IOC team not limited by time needed to retrieve archived glass slidesEasy archiving of digital imagesImages readily accessibleQuality assurance studiesConferences and teachingMedicolegal purposesFocal findings on a specific intraoperatively prepared slide can be annotated and savedEasier correlation with final permanent section evaluationAnnotation of image does not permanently obscure finding on glass slideComputer-aided interpretationImage analysis to assist in interpretation of slides may become an option in futureComputer [artificial intelligence (AI)]-assisted diagnosisAI screening for focal findings, such as small metastasesMore reliable quantification of findings is important for assessment and IOC decision makinge.g., counting neutrophils in cases of suspected joint infectionRegulatory IssuesCollege of American Pathologists Accreditation Requirements for TelepathologyCAP Laboratory Accreditation ChecklistAs of 2022, the section on Telepathology and Remote Data assessment is contained in the \"Laboratory General\" section; testing within the laboratory using the laboratory's validated software is specifically excluded from this checklist sectionTelepathology modes definedStatic telepathology: Preselected still image(s)Dynamic telepathology: Real-time viewing of images (includes robotic microscopy, video streaming, and desktop sharing)Virtual slides/whole-slide imaging (WSI): Digitization of entire slideChecklist section applies toPrimary diagnoses made by telepathologyFrozen section diagnosesFormal 2nd-opinion consultationsAncillary techniques in which the pathologist participates in interpretation of imagesReal-time evaluation of fine-needle aspiration specimens for triaging and preliminary diagnosesChecklist items as of 2022GEN.50057: There is a method for the individual reviewing cases to ensure correct patient identification for slides/images and data files submitted for reviewGEN.50614: The individual reviewing cases has access to pertinent clinical information at the time of slide/image(s) or remote data

director (or designee who meets CAP director qualifications) before the technology is used for the intended diagnostic purpose(s)GEN.51728: The lab has a procedure addressing training requirements for all users of the telepathology systemGEN.52842: There are procedures in place to ensure that sites engaging in telepathology and remote data assessment provide reasonable confidentiality and securityGEN.52850: The telepathology records include diagnoses made and statements of adequacy assessment, preliminary diagnosis, or recommendations for additional studies provided at the time of evaluationGEN.52860: The telepathology services are included in the laboratory's quality management programGEN.52900: There are records showing that all users of the WSI system have been trainedGEN.52920: The laboratory validates WSI systems used for clinical diagnostic purposes by performing its own validation studies, including approval for use by the laboratory director (or designee who meets CAP director qualifications) before the technology is used for the intended diagnostic purpose(s)The checklist is not applicable toInformal reviews without formal reportingEducational or research useGovernmental Regulations for TelepathologyWSI has been approved as an FDA class II diagnostic device in the United States for primary pathology diagnosisIn the last 5 years, several systems have received approval for marketingThis has also improved the general climate for labs and systems to expand the use of WSI for primary diagnosis as a laboratory developed test (LDT)WSI has been approved and is employed in Canada for primary pathology diagnosisIOC diagnosis in most cases can be reasonably regarded as preliminary in nature, subject to subsequent review in the context of permanent and additional sections and, therefore, not a final primary diagnosisExceptions to this characterization would include specimens completely exhausted by protocol for IOC diagnosis &/or not retained for permanent section (e.g., Mohs surgery)Consensus guidelines for validation of WSI have been published and includeAll laboratories using WSI clinically should implement their own validation studiesValidation can encompass the entire WSI system (i.e., each component need not be separately validated)A qualified pathologist should be involvedValidation should be appropriate to intended clinical useValidation slides for IOC should employ intraoperatively prepared frozen sections or cytology preparationsStudy should establish glass slide/digital image intraobserver variabilityValidation should emulate real-world environmentWash-out periods between review of glass slide and digital image mandatedValidation should confirm that all material present on the glass slide is included in the digital image60 cases has been suggested as a requirement for a single application, which should reflect spectrum and complexity of case typesLicensurePathologists may make diagnoses on specimens from different institutions, different states, or different countriesLicensure requirements vary by jurisdictionRequirements in both receiving and sending jurisdictions must be followedIt is typical for pathologists performing telepathology consultations to be licensed in multiple statesReimbursementAt this time, diagnoses by telepathology are billable in the same manner as direct on-site evaluationCategories of Telepathology MethodsStaticStill digital images are taken from preselected areasThe digital camera may beA fixed part of a microscopeA camera, phone, or other camera-containing device attached to an eyepiecePhotographs are transmitted to a consultant, usually as JPEG attachmentsEmailText messageLess commonly as image cache accessed from remote computerAdvantagesInexpensive and fastRecipient does not need special equipment or computer to review images1st-line pathologist can select and carefully capture areas of concernVery focal findingsCytology findings, particularly if focal or if smear is suboptimalNo requirement for real-time interaction with the person in the IOC roomUseful for cases in which rapid diagnosis is needed for expedited postoperative, but not necessarily intraoperative, managementImages can be kept as a permanent file and attached to a case in some laboratory information systemsDisadvantagesQuality of images for review is heavily influenced by expertise and bias of 1st-line pathologistSubspecialty expertise may be needed for both selection and interpretation of key areasExcept for very small pieces of tissue, ability of consultant to evaluate the entire specimen is limitedAbsolutely dependent on prosector; subject to sampling errorOnly portions of tissue are captured on the slide and only at set magnificationsDynamic/RoboticTransmission of a video stream from a microscope to a receiving pathologistThe slide is viewed on a microscope with a digital or analog video cameraVideo images are transferred to a remote site by closed network or web-based sharing systemsMicroscope stage movement and focus may be controlled byOn-site personnel under verbal direction of a remote pathologistA pathologist on-site, directing a remote consultant's attention to selected areasOff-site pathologist via robotic microscopyWeb-based sharing systemsRequire computer at on-site video captureCan use computer, phone, or handheld device (for commercially available systems with device applications)AdvantagesAll information available on a slide is potentially available to an off-site pathologistIf a robotic microscope controlled by an off-site pathologist is used, this closely mimics a pathologist being on-siteViewing of images takes place in real time with communication between a person on-site and a pathologistDisadvantagesIf the on-site person controls the microscope, quality is heavily dependent on sender expertiseCan be time consuming for off-site pathologistAvailable products vary significantly in user experienceImages are not routinely savedWhole-Slide ImagesLarge images composed of many smaller static images stitched togetherAfter preparation, the entire slide is scanned, uploaded, and stored as a digitized image on institution- or cloud-based serverA digitized image can be viewed on a computer by an off-site pathologistAdvantagesDoes not require expertise to choose the most diagnostic areas of a slideProvides closest experience to (and sometimes better than) on-site viewing of glass slidesSpecialized software allows viewing of slide at different magnificationsImage can be kept permanently, viewed at any time, and annotated for permanent section correlationDisadvantagesTime to scan a slide is dependent on the size of the tissue area and magnificationScanning at 40x very slow (but usually not necessary)Slide preparation is extremely importantClean, glue freePlacement of tissue centrally on glassMinimal folds or other artifacts that vary thickness of tissuePersonnel must be well trained in using the instrumentNot suitable for multiple users with minimal training &/or episodic experienceCytology slides should be uniformly thin and may require 40x scanningScanners are expensiveStored file sizes for WSI are extremely large1 image at a single focal depth does not capture information from the entire thickness of tissue on a slideMay be important when evaluating very small structures, such as mitotic figuresAdvanced systems image a slide at multiple focal depths (Z axis)However, this greatly increases scanning time and file size for each slideTissue marking dyes for margins often appear darker and can be misinterpretedIdeally, a frozen section would only include a single margin for evaluationEx Vivo MicroscopyImages are obtained from fresh tissue using reflected light of various wavelengthsThe digital images are viewed on an on-site screen or via telepathologyAdvantagesMinimal or no tissue preparation is neededImage acquisition is rapid (< 3 minutes)Freezing artifact is avoidedDisadvantagesRequires expensive specialized equipmentCurrently in research and development stage for most systemsArtifacts specific to these techniques may be introducedOnly the surface of the tissue is imagedHybrid MethodsEmploy combinations of dynamic or robotic methods with WSI or ex vivo microscopyIntegration of Telepathology Into Intraoperative ConsultationGross ExaminationQualified personnel on-site are critical to successful and safe provision of servicesResidents, pathology assistants, or specialized technologistsAct as qualified prosectors, following established protocolsMay be 1st responder on call, especially if attending pathologist lives in remote locationMay be used in hospitals without regular attending pathologist samplingDynamic streaming may be needed for direction of large specimen samplingIn an ideal system, images of large gross specimens are captured as digital photographs with annotation for frozen section sampling sitesPreparation of SlidesPersonnel on-site prepare cytologic or frozen section slidesMicroscopic ExaminationImage capture remains \"add-on\" to workflow for on-site personnelStatic image telepathology: Images are taken by cameraUsually requires at least pathology residency training to select diagnostic areasRobotic telepathology: Slide is placed on microscope stageWSI: Slides must be placed in scannerAttending pathologistIf the pathologist is on-site, slides can be viewed directly via microscope, or images can be viewed on screenIf the pathologist is off-site, slides &/or images can be viewed according to system utilizedIn either situation, the pathologist can use telepathology for subspecialist or 2nd opinion on unusual or challenging casesQuality AssuranceThe IOC quality assurance program should specifically address telepathology accuracy and qualityMultiple studies are available in the literature documenting the comparable reliability of image-performed IOCs to those performed on glass slides and can be used for benchmarking",
