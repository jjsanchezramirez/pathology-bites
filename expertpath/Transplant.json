asThrombomodulin (THBD)Plasminogen (PLG)Diacylglycerol kinase epsilon (DGKE)Regulation and Dysregulation of Alternate Complement PathwayDuring regulated activation of alternate pathway, the following events take placeComplement FH competes with complement factor B (FB) to bind C3bInhibits generation of C3 convertaseFH binds glycosaminoglycans on endothelial surfacesMembrane cofactor protein (MCP

patients have combination of 2 pathogenic variants (digenic)Suggests disease may result from additive effects of multiple genetic factorsIn addition, SNPs on other complement genes, such as C4bp (C4 binding protein), CFHR1, CD46 (MCP), and CFH, reported at higher frequency in aHUS patients compared to healthy controlsSuch SNPs may constitute minor susceptibility to aHUSCould influence development and severity of diseaseDisease-affected family members with inherited variant-related aHUS have other genetic susceptibility factors for aHUSWhile healthy carriers with same variant do not have additional susceptibility factorsChallenging to assess influence of each SNP and gene-gene interactions in specific patientsBecause penetrance and expression of aHUS influenced by epigenetic and environmental factorsGenetic testing for several complement regulatory genes complicated by extensive sequence homology between genes, e.g., CFH and CFHR genesCFH gene variants are most common in aHUSCFH encodes FH proteinHas 20 globular domains called short consensus repeatsBy alternative splicing, CFH also encodes smaller protein called FH-like 1 (FHL-1)Close to CFH gene locus, there are 5 genes encoding proteins structurally related to CFH called CFH-related proteins (CFHR1-5)CFHR1-5 region contains multiple genomic duplicationsThis area is susceptible to genomic rearrangements, such as gene conversion or nonhomologous recombinationSome rearrangements associated with aHUS, e.g., CFH-CFHR1 hybrid geneHomozygous deletion of CFHR1-CFHR3 associated with presence of FH autoantibodiesWhile heterozygous deletions are frequently observedRearrangements are not identified by standard next-generation sequencing techniquesRequire other analytic methods that evaluate for deletion/duplications and copy number variationsMulticenter cohorts assessing 795 aHUS patients screened for CFH, CFI, CD46 (MCP), CFB, and C3 gene variants3.4% of patients had combined pathogenic

2, or 3 genesDisease-risk haplotypes in CFH (c.1-332C>T, c.2808G>T) and MCP (c.897T>C)When present in ≥ 1 copy, significantly increases risk of penetrance in digenic patients, though penetrance still remains incompleteFamilial occurrence of aHUS observed in 20% of pedigreesEither autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance patternAge at onset in adults is similar, regardless of genetic

option to correct underlying genetic complement abnormality and prevent disease recurrenceRecommendations, that in patients with CFH or CFI genetic variants, combined liver-kidney (if there is also ESRD) or isolated liver transplant (if renal function is normal or has recovered) should be consideredNo guidelines on whether combined liver-kidney or liver alone transplants should be considered for patients with genetic variants in other complement regulatory genesLiver transplant, combined with renal or in isolation, is not widespread procedure for long-term correction and management of aHUSEculizumab and aHUSEculizumab (Soliris, Alexion) is humanized monoclonal antibody targeting terminal complement pathwayBinds with high affinity to complement protein, C5, and prevents generation of anaphylotoxin, C5a, and MAC (C5b-C9)Several studies demonstrated its efficacy in controlling complement activation in patients with aHUS pre- and post transplantationIn patients with CFH or CFI variants and aHUS, eculizumab used pre- and post transplantationDuration of administration in latter setting is unknownEculizumab is very expensiveAlternate approaches to wean off have been studied, though long-term, large cohort data are still lackingOne alternate strategy to adopt combined liver-kidney transplant in patients with ESRD, but this has substantial riskOften need intensive plasmapheresis in pre- and perioperative period to ensure optimal complement levelsStandard dosing of eculizumab for recurrent aHUS is 900 mg, IV, every week for 4 weeks, followed by 1,200 mg biweeklyDuration of eculizumab treatment has not been optimizedMany centers continue it indefinitely, but determination should be made on case-by-case basisPatients with persistent symptoms on eculizumab may also be treated with either plasmapheresis or plasma infusionEculizumab treatment carries risk for life-threatening meningococcal infections due to blockade of terminal pathway of complement activationPatients considered for eculizumab therapy should receive meningococcal vaccine at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of therapy, and, additionally, antimicrobial prophylaxis can be consideredIf urgent eculizumab therapy is indicated, antimicrobial prophylaxis can be administered simultaneouslyLaboratory Testing for Diagnosis of aHUS and Monitoring of EculizumabPatients who manifest features of HUS should be evaluated to eliminate possibility of Shiga-toxin-associated HUSADAMTS13 level and activity should also be measured to assess for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)If ADAMTS13 results are > 5-10%, then investigation for aHUS should includeSerologic (serum or plasma) measurement of AH50 (functional assessment of alternate complement pathway)C3 and C4 levelsMeasurement of FH, FI, and FB levels, FH autoantibodies, and sMAC levelsProvide measure of terminal activation of complementCD46 (MCP) expression can be measured on surface of leukocytes by flow cytometryGenetic testing for variants in complement regulatory genesShould include deletion/duplication analysis and Sanger sequencing for homologous regionsEssential for complement serologic analysis to collect and transport blood specimens appropriately for further processing and analysisDue to likelihood of in vitro complement activation and consumption by sample handlingAdditionally, split products, such as C3Bb and C4d, can also be assessed as markers of complement activationNormal range for plasma FH is large and influenced by genetic and environmental factorsChallenging to detect heterozygous FH deficiency by plasma measurementsSpecific monoclonal antibodies detect 2 allotypes of FHY402H (Tyr402His) in SCR7 domain of CFH and CFHL1Y402 and H402 utilizing common CFH SNPThis method allowsDetermination of contribution of each CFH allele, in heterozygous Y402H individuals, to total plasma FH and FHL-1 protein poolRapid and simple identification of patients carrying CFH null allelesThese patients may be missed by standard FH plasma quantitation methodsQuick assessment of impact of specific CFH variants on protein expressionEculizumab treatment can be monitored by measuring C5 protein level and C5 functionNew mass spectrometry assay that can quantify eculizumab drug, which, in conjunction with C5 level and functional monitoring, can provide insight into dosage and potential duration of administrationMay indirectly provide information on presence of antidrug antibodies in individuals who may appear refractory to therapy after prolonged use, but there is no direct way of determining thisSummaryAtypical HUS represents multifactorial etiology, which is initiated by trigger events, including infections, drugs, malignancy, transplantation, pregnancy, and autoimmune diseasesResults in endothelial cell injury and thrombi in small vesselsGenetic variants in coagulation genes, such as PLG, ADAMTS13, and DGKE, can contribute to pathology at this stageDirect lysis by MAC and thrombus formation can cause mechanical damage to erythrocytes, which, in presence of genetic variants in complement regulatory genes, e.g., CFH, CFI, C3, CFB, CD46 (MCP), or autoantibodies to FH, results in overactivation of complementaHUS can lead to ESRD, which requires treatment with either eculizumab &/or renal transplantationDuration of eculizumab treatment in individuals with genetic aHUS can be lifelong unless combined liver-kidney or liver transplant is performed in suitable patients under appropriate conditionsDecision to discontinue eculizumab treatment pre- or post renal transplantation made on case-by-case basis, depending on clinical context and genetic defectLaboratory studies can help with diagnosis of aHUS as well as monitoring of

anergy or apoptosis on cognate interaction with antigen-specific T cellsMacrophages do not effectively prime naive T cells but play key role in immediate posttransplant periodDonor and recipient macrophages infiltrate allografts and proliferateAbsolute numbers of macrophages decrease in absence of rejectionIn acute rejection, macrophage infiltration accounts for 40-60% of cellular infiltrate and performs following rolesProduction of proinflammatory cytokinesPhagocytose necrotic cell debrisProduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS)Presents antigen to effector T cellsNeutrophils also mediate tissue injury via cytotoxic and proinflammatory mechanismsNK cells are important innate lymphocytes, and while unlikely to solely mediate allograft rejection, they act as facilitators by amplifying early graft inflammation and supporting T-cell alloreactivityComplement activation, when unchecked, can result in tissue (allograft) injuryPlays key role in AMR by promoting alloantigen-specific B-cell maturation and reducing threshold for B-cell stimulation by antigensPeripheral synthesis of complement characteristic of newly transplanted organsDetermines allograft

cofactors for antigen presentation and increase activation of naive alloreactive T cellsRoles of complementComplement triggered by binding of alloantibodies to donor organ endothelial cellsSignificant variability in endothelial cell response to pathogenic antibody and complement3 possible outcomesImmediate thrombosis and allograft infarctLesser injury with gradual decline of allograft function due to complement depositionNo injuryAll these phenomena can contribute to allograft damage and rejectionInfection, Tissue Damage, and Immune Response in SOTInfections and AlloreactivityInfections (viral) in pretransplant period can induce memory T cells that cross react with allogeneic MHC through direct allorecognition (heterologous immunity)Alloreactive memory T cells are more important in allograft rejection because ofPropensity for rapid expansionProduction of inflammatory and cytotoxic effector mediatorsPretransplant frequency of donor-specific memory T cells (producing IFN-γ) in renal transplant patients correlates with risk of posttransplant rejection episodesPosttransplant bacterial, fungal, and viral infections also associate with development of acute or chronic rejection, depending on type of SOT and infectionActivation of PRRs by infection results in eventual T-cell activation and differentiation with downstream activation of other hematopoietic cells that may participate in rejectionDifferent pathogens elicit different classes of immune responseViral and intracellular bacterial infections drive responses mediated by Th1 cells, cytotoxic CD8 T cells, and NK cellsExtracellular bacteria trigger both Th1- and Th17-mediated responsesFungal infections stimulate predominantly Th17-mediated responsesType I interferons (IFNs) produced during viral and intracellular bacterial infections and stimulate immune responsesTreatment of recurrent hepatitis C viral (HCV) infections with IFN-α in transplant patients facilitates viral clearance but increases risk of allograft rejectionBesides bystander effects of infections (via cytokines) on T-cell activation, infections directly influence uptake and presentation of alloantigensIndirect allorecognition (alloantigen uptake and presentation by recipient APC on MHC class I or II to alloreactive T cells) is crucial in late rejection (may also play role in acute rejection)Infections in allograft may facilitate more effective alloantigen presentation (via uptake of alloantigens and PAMPs in same phagosome) and promote rejectionCertain infections [e.g., Cytomegalovirus (CMV)] may have immunosuppressive effect systemically, which predisposes to opportunistic superinfectionsIncreased rate of CMV infection and reactivation of HHV6 and HHV7Course of HCV infection exacerbated by CMV preinfection in liver transplantIncreased risk (7-10x) of Epstein-Barr virus-posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (EBV-PTLD) in CMV-infected compared to noninfected transplant patientsMechanism of infection-associated immunosuppression (IS) may be related to endogenous glucocorticoid production during viral and bacterial infections, which can transiently induce systemic ISCan result in increased severity of secondary infections but also reduces alloreactivityNew therapeutic approaches focus on blocking innate immune responses that stimulate alloreactivity but not protective immunity to infectionse.g., rapamycin (sirolimus) increases magnitude and quality of effector and memory CD8 T-cell responses to infection but inhibits alloreactive CD8 T-cell responsesDanger Signals and Role in SOTPAMPs allow innate recognition of invading pathogensDAMPs also activate innate immunity via recognition of endogenous cellular stress \"danger\" signalsDAMPs can be subclassified based on physiologic presence and propertiesIntracellular molecules, including nucleic acids, and heat-shock proteins (HSPs)Not accessible normally to immune systemOnly released into extracellular environment or expressed on cell surface after cell damageExtracellular molecules, including extracellular matrix components, altered by cellular stress or injuryProcess of organ harvesting and transplantation alone can generate DAMPs and activate innate immunityMost DAMPs signal through TLRs, resulting in NF-κB activation and activation of inflammatory response genes, production of inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil recruitment, preparation of APC, and upregulation of costimulatory molecules and MHCDue to pivotal role of TLRs in organ transplantation process and outcomes, defects in TLR signaling could improve transplant successDemonstrated in lung recipients and liver and kidney transplant donors who had loss-of-function (LOF) TLR4 polymorphismOther than TLRs, DAMPs also signal through non-PRRs, e.g., ligation of RAGE, which can act in concert with TLR activation to modulate inflammatory responseDAMPs can drive fibrosis-based tissue restructuring in allograft; generate different downstream signals compared to PAMPsEffect of DAMPs on rates of rejection and graft dysfunction provide avenues for therapeutic interventionEither via decreasing DAMP expression, enhancing clearance, or blocking signalingImportant DAMPs in SOT, depending on transplant organ: HMGB1, ATP, HSPs, nucleic acids, heparan sulfate, hyaluronan, fibronectin, haptoglobinSome like haptoglobin and heparan sulfate are relevant in specific organs, e.g., heart and kidney respectively, while most other DAMPs are relevant for multiple organsNK Cells and Immune Response in SOTNK-Cell-Mediated Responses in Rejection and

is their role in tolerance inductionBoth activating and inhibitory NK-cell receptors required for mediating toleranceSecretion of IL-10 in response to infection is example of NK-cell regulation in systemic inflammationIL-10 is immunoregulatory cytokine and key host factor in inducing and maintaining T-cell exhaustion and facilitating viral persistenceIn chronically infected HCV patients, NK cells produce both IL-10 and IFN-γNK-cell regulation of immune response requires both cytotoxicity and cytokine productionNK-cell immune responses regulated in turn by TregsTGF-β produced by Tregs suppresses cytotoxic profile of NK cells, inhibits granzyme A and B and CD16 expression, and downregulates activating receptor, NKG2DDepletion of Tregs enhances NK-cell proliferation and cytotoxicityUnique role of NK cells determine if downstream T-cell response skews toward tolerance or rejection based on their effector functionB-Cell Immune Responses in SOTAcute and Chronic Antibody-Mediated Rejection and ImmunosuppressionRole of donor-specific alloantibodies (DSA) well established in allograft rejectionNon-donor-specific HLA antibodies reported and appear earlier compared to DSAWeaning IS or homeostatic repopulation after immune cell depletion can lower threshold for B-cell activationMay facilitate DSA production, C4d (+) injury, and chronic rejectionSeveral commonly used transplant immunosuppression (IS) agents influence B-cell activation and DSA production to varying degreesAlemtuzumab, monoclonal anti-CD52 antibody when used as induction agent, especially in absence of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) ISCauses B-cell suppression for 3-12 monthsBut associates with increased incidence of AMR in patients with preformed DSABelatacept, CTLA4 fusion proteinBinds CD80/CD86Blocks interaction with CD28 (inhibiting T-cell costimulation)Decreases incidence of de novo alloantibody productionBortezomib, proteasome inhibitorShown in early studies to reverse AMR and decrease DSA after plasmapheresisAdditional studies needed to achieve robust elimination of DSA and durable allograft maintenanceEspecially in subset of patients who have high levels of DSA pretransplant or either unresponsive or transiently responsive to treatmentNF-κB and T Cells in SOTRole of NF-κB and T Cells in Transplant Immune ResponseNF-κB, pleiotropic transcription factor, ubiquitously expressedPost SOT, NF-κB in allograft parenchymal cells activated due to ischemic reperfusion injury (IRI)Also expressed in intragraft-infiltrating cells (activated allogeneic T cells) during acute allograft rejectionProduces proinflammatory cytokinesTNFIL-1βIL-6IFN-γ produced during IRI leading to tissue damage mediated by neutrophils and monocytesSeveral of these cytokines

of inflammationPromotes tissue injury (release of ROS)T-cell activation through T-cell receptor signals NF-κB activation and eventually IL2 gene transcription and T-cell proliferationAlloantigen recognition and T-cell activation in allograft rejection includesDirect (intact donor HLA presenting \"normal\" antigen to recipient T cells) pathwayIndirect (alloantigen presentation by recipient DCs) pathwayNF-κB activation via canonical pathway also critical for thymic generation of natural Tregs, which suppresses allograft immune responses and prolongs allograft survivalCanonical pathway for NF-kB activation includes induction by physiologic NF-κB stimuli and represented by TNFR1 signaling through binding of TRADD and recruitment of FADD and TRAF2IκBα phosphorylated in IKKβ- and NEMO-dependent manner, resulting in nuclear translocation of p65-containing heterodimersAnimal model data suggests that NF-κB may be important for Treg development but inhibitory for Treg

appears to be viable therapeutic target in transplantationRisk:benefit ratio has to be assessed and toxicity of such therapies reducedFor more immunogenic transplanted organs, additional or alternate therapies may be needed since allograft rejection can take place in context of NF-κB-impaired T cellsImmunosuppressive Therapy in SOTModulation of Immune ResponseIS in current era primarily antibody based (but CNI and mTOR inhibitors also used)Both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies used to prevent and treat allograft rejectionReduces incidence of acute rejection episodesImproves short- and long-term graft survival but increased risk for both opportunistic infections and posttransplant malignanciesIS used to target or control 1 or more of 3 alloimmune response phases (signal 1-3)Induction IS based on type of SOT: 70-80% of SOT use induction with exception of liver transplant; only 20% of liver transplants use inductionImmune response in SOT can be summarized in 3-signal modelSignal 1: Initiation of T-cell activation by alloantigen presentation on MHC class II by APCsSignal 2: Expansion of T-cell activation with costimulatory signals (CD80/CD86 interaction with CD28)Signal 3: Culmination of T-cell activation with stimulation of calcium-calcineurin pathwayResults in production of IL-2 by activated T cellsIL-2 binds IL-2R on activated T cells and triggers mTORInduces T-cell proliferation and further cytokine productionIS regimens typically consist of triple drug-maintenance therapy acting at different levels of immune response cascadeInduction agents act at signal 1 by effacing lymphocyte depletion (e.g., ATG, alemtuzumab)CNI and IL-2R antagonists act at signal 1 and 3 (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus)Inhibit cytokine production and IL-2-mediated activation of mTORAntiproliferative agents [e.g., mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), azathioprine] act downstream of signal 3Inhibit purine synthesis and work in concert with mTOR inhibitors (e.g., sirolimus)Inhibits T-cell proliferationCostimulation inhibitors (e.g., belatacept) act on signal 2Block binding of CD80 and CD86 to CD28 receptorSummaryManipulation of Immune Response in SOTSuccess of allotransplantation depends on optimizing IS to curb allograft-damaging immune responses while maintaining effective immunity against pathogensImmune response against transplanted organs originates from several genetic barriersBlood group antigensHLAMinor histocompatibility antigensImmune response gene polymorphisms that modulate risk of infection or rejectionControl of immune response in SOT requires multipronged approachMinimize IS (personalized strategies)Identify regimens for tolerance inductionPreserve immunity to pathogensAll these aspects may require combination of pharmacologic intervention along with adoptive immunotherapies, which include adoptive transfer of ex vivo-expanded Tregs, antiviral cytotoxic T cells, and other types of regulatory immune cells",

infections, and sustained allograft function at 1-year post transplantRespond differently in various physiologic contexts, e.g.,In noninflammatory settings, MSCs promote tissue regeneration and repair and do not exacerbate immunogenicityIn presence of inflammatory cytokines, MSCs are highly immunosuppressive and express MHC, allowing effective allograft toleranceSeveral clinical trials of MSCs in solid organ transplantationMost in kidney but also single trials in lung, liver, and islet cellPreliminary results encouraging but need additional studies to ensure optimal outcomes while maximizing patient safetyMSCs, by definition, are adherent cells that express CD105, CD73, CD90Lack expression of CD45, CD34, CD14, CD11b, CD79-α, MHC class IIShould be capable of pluripotency and differentiate under appropriate conditions to different cell line lineagesSince MSCs preferentially home to sites of vascular damage or inflammation, they may mitigate toxic effects of ischemia-reperfusion injury, which can trigger innate and adaptive immune responseHCT used successfully to achieve immunologic tolerance in patients receiving living donor renal transplantsStable complete or mixed chimerism can allow long-term maintenance (3 months to > 10 years) of allograft without need for exogenous immunosuppressionHowever, mixed chimerism more favorable at reducing GVHD than complete chimerismChimerism seems essential for induction of tolerance but not maintenanceChronic rejection can appear in patients with transient mixed chimerism indicating that, without stable chimerism, there will be loss of

toleranceInconsequential to allograft outcome in human lung and kidney transplant recipientsComparison of transplant recipients ± allo-cross-reactive memory T cells noted similar allograft outcomes among both groupsHepatitis C Virus and Liver TransplantationLiver transplant recipients with chronic hepatitis C infection, who successfully weaned off immunosuppression yet maintained allograft tolerance, demonstratedExhaustion of HCV-specific circulating CD8 (+) T-cell poolExpression of IFN-stimulated genes and immune regulation genes in liver tissueHCV-specific CD8 (+) T cells capable of cross reacting with allogeneic HLA class I molecules found in transplanted and nontransplanted HCV-infected patientsNone developed T-cell-mediated rejection of allograft, even after cessation of antiviral treatment against HCVHCV-associated HI may conversely result in suppression of alloimmune response through immune exhaustion and promote transplant toleranceViral Infection and Allograft RejectionAugmented immunosuppression to treat T-cell- or antibody-mediated allograft rejection increases host vulnerability to viruses by inhibiting or depleting antiviral cellular response or limiting neutralization of virions by antibodiesConversely, no in vitro evidence to date linking viral infection directly to T-cell- or antibody-mediated allograft rejectionIn response to viral reactivation or viral infection, decrease in immunosuppression may potentiate allograft sensitizationIndirectly resulting in allograft rejectionCMV DNAemia correlated with upregulation of adhesion molecules on infected allograft cells promoting infiltration and local inflammation by NK and T cellsFurther potentiated by uninfected bystander allograft cellsUpregulate MHC class I to recruit cytotoxic CD8 (+) T cellsBKV infection results in kidney allograft injury, promoting local inflammation and tubular atrophyHerpesviridae and Secondary Hemophagocytic LymphohistiocytosisHerpesviridae, particularly EBV (20%) and CMV, are common infectious triggers of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)Exact mechanism not well understoodPathway culminates with continued T-cell stimulation by antigen-presenting cellsResults in uncontrolled T-cell activation, proliferation, and hypercytokinemia leading to tissue damage and hyperinflammatory stateSpecific inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) predispose to EBV infection, resulting in HLH or malignancye.g., loss-of-function (LOF) variants in MAGT1, ITK, CD27, CD70, CTPS1, RASGRP1, CARMIL2, among others2022 EULAR/ACR criteria provide updated evidence-based clinical and laboratory characteristics for HLH and related disordersExcessive hyperinflammation is spectrum, and clinical and laboratory data must be interpreted in integrated mannerHLH-like inflammatory presentation may occur in many clinical contexts, including viral sepsisProgression to hyperinflammatory state requires acute precipitators/environmental triggers and underlying host risk factorsCD38 (+)/HLA-DR (+)-activated CD8 (+) T cells, type II IFN signature, CXCL9, sIL2R are valuable biomarkers to diagnose HLH, regardless of primary or secondary originThough hyperferritinemia is nonspecific, in context of elevated biomarkers, pretest probability (Bayes theorem) of HLH/hyperinflammation will be increasedEBV and Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative DisorderPosttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD): Devastating complication of EBV infection in SOT; majority are B-cell neoplasia within 1st year post transplant (early PTLD)Risk factors for early EBV-PTLD includePrimary EBV infectionType of organ transplantUse of T-cell- or lymphocyte-depleting agentsAge of recipient (pediatric)CMV mismatch or active diseaseRapidly increasing EBV DNAemiaChronic EBV DNAemiaEBV is promiscuous in its cellular targets (B, T, NK, monocytes, etc.)B cells are most common cell subset infected by EBVPathophysiology of EBV-PTLD involves impaired T-cell responsesImmunosuppression targeting T cells in transplant recipients hampers EBV-directed antiviral response compared to immunocompetent hostsEBV establishes latency in host B lymphocytes after prior exposure or donor B lymphocytes retained in allograft of seronegative transplant recipientsUnchecked EBV proliferation and resultant constitutive activation of B-cell reservoir leads to malignant transformationHighly associated with variations in inhibitory HLA-E/LMP-1/NKG2A pathway: EBV strains encoding for LMP-1 variants and host expression of HLA-E*0103/0103LMP-1 variant epitopes, GGDPHLPTL or GGDPPLPTL, potently inhibit NKG2A (+) NK and CD8(+) T-cellsHLA-E*0103/0103 prevents viral dissemination in vitro, which protects against infectious mononucleosis, but is overexpressed in EBV (+) PTLD patientsUtilization of Immune-Competent Cells to Control Viral infection in Solid Organ TransplantationAdoptive ImmunotherapyEmploys virus-specific functional T cells (VSTs) from uninfected donor to combat viral infection in infected transplant recipientWhole blood obtained from donor, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are isolatedPBMCs stimulated ex vivo with peptides (or peptide mixtures) that reflect antigenic epitopes specific to target virusPBMC cultures additionally supported by cytokines to promote T-cell expansion ex vivoQuality control performed and cellular product assessed for functional viability and alloreactivity of T cellsOn obtaining optimal IFN-γ response to viral antigen, product intravenously infused into infected transplant recipientMay be donor derived (allograft donor) or 3rd party (healthy adult volunteers)Must be HLA matchedCloser HLA matching obtained from donor-derived productVirologic response may take 2-4 weeksVirus-specific T-cell therapies in clinical practice: Efficacy reported in refractory viral infections in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) but limited studies conducted in SOTAgainst BKV3 patients with BKV viremia, hemorrhagic cystitis, or BKPV-associated nephropathy after transplant with complete response (33%) or partial response (67%)Complete response defined as undetectable viral load (PCR) within 4-week period after last VST infusion, or resolution of hemorrhagic cystitis and no clinical cystitis symptomsPartial response defined as > 50% reduction in viral load (PCR) within 4-week period following VST infusion, or reduction of hemorrhagic cystitis by ≥ 1 grade and associated clinical symptomsAgainst CMVIndications for CMV VST include refractory DNAemia, DNAemia with end-organ disease, including hepatitis and pneumonitisDecrease in viral load (PCR) noted in all VST recipientsCohort of 13 adult SOT patients (renal, lung, and heart) noted virologic response in 85% of VST recipientsWell tolerated with stable allograft functionAgainst EBVPrimarily used in patients with EBV-driven malignancies, such as PTLDCohort of adult SOT recipients received EBV-VSTs for refractory or high-risk EBV (+) PTLDAll patients received chemotherapy and rituximab (CD20-based B-cell depletion) prior to VSTsComplete virologic response achieved in 40% of patients prior to administration of VSTs; remainder (3 patients) achieved complete response following VSTComplete response defined as clearance of EBV DNAemiaPartial response defined as decrease in viral load by 1 log10Current gold standard uses pharmacologic agents and biologic therapies (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) to control viral infection &/or manage end-organ diseaseCellular therapies used often as adjunct therapy or last resort for refractory viral infectionQuestions utility of early intervention in SOT to prevent progression to organ involvement and systemic diseasePrimary concern for early deployment of cellular therapies is risk for allosensitization and cost and logistics involvedUnclear if cellular therapy is superior to conventional antiviral treatmentsNeed well-designed clinical trialsSummaryImpact of Viral Infections on Immune Response in Solid Organ TransplantationCoordinated effort between innate and adaptive immune system required to combat viral infectionLack of functional innate immunity, particularly NK cells, can result in viral invasion of host cellsAbsence of functional effector lymphocytes allows ongoing viral replication and persistenceAside from inadequate immune response, viruses may also manipulate components of virus-host interaction to evade detection by APCs, T cells, and NK cellsCertain viruses elicit strong inflammatory milieu that results in systemic immune dysregulation and lead to hyperinflammatory states (e.g., HLH) or malignancy (e.g., PTLD)Advances in cellular therapies enable use of VSTs to manage viral infection in transplant recipients with dampened cellular responses",

innate and adaptive immune responsesBHOT panel now validatedExpression results for gene sets can be represented as scores: Geometric mean of fold changes across all transcripts in gene setGene set scores represent molecular measurements of discrete molecular processes in tissue associated with respective histopathology/Banff lesions (e.g., interstitial or microcirculation inflammation), Banff diagnoses, allograft function, or outcomeIndividual members in gene sets (sometimes several hundred) change their expression in coordinated, stereotyped fashion and move in large groups, reflecting major disease processes in renal allograftsMolecular spatial profiling methods (single-cell sequencing, digital spatial profiling, in situ mass spectrometry) allow assessment of gene or protein expression in spatial context of organ structure or at cellular/subcellular level = in situ mechanistic insightsLimitationsChallenge with generating whole-transcriptome expression results lies in fact that number of omics results per specimen (tens of thousands) by far exceeds sample sizeAny statistical analysis is susceptible to find accidental \"significant\" associations to clinical pathologic variables while not reflecting true biologic disease mechanisms, i.e., to overfit expression dataNo consensus exists for uniform statistical analysesLoss of spatial context Integrating high-dimensional data outputs from omics platforms for patient care requires sophisticated postanalytical refinement and complex quality assurance processes to be clinically usefulFor class prediction (e.g., predicting diagnosis of new sample solely from molecular assessment), classifiers are frequently usedClassifiers: Mathematical algorithms that assign new sample to class based on input data (e.g., molecular phenotype) regarding its probabilities for belonging to specific class/diagnosis/outcomeUsually built using machine-learning algorithms/artificial intelligence tools by training on cases with correct diagnosesBuilding classifier represents challenge if no true diagnostic gold standard is availableSignificant obstacle for validating new omics diagnostics in clinical transplant practiceClassification dependent on mix and number of casesDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSESNK-cell and endothelial transcripts discriminate AMR from TCMR and mixed rejectionTCMR reflected by effector T-cell and macrophage infiltration and activation-associated transcriptsMixed rejection dominated by transcripts that are interferon-γ-inducible parenchymal endothelial cells &/or macrophagesAssessing \"top\" transcripts from respective molecular phenotype suffices to determine association with respective diagnosisSince significant overlap in molecular phenotypes, quantitative thresholds still need to be determined and clinically validated before molecular differential diagnosis can become standard of careAppropriate clinical context of use (i.e., where does test add value to patient care) still needs to be defined for molecular transplant diagnostics, despite several products being commercially availableTo date, most value from transcript assessment added in differential diagnoses of AMRSubset of Banff borderline cases have similar molecular phenotype as TCMR and behave like rejectionMajor difference is quantitative for borderline cases that do not behave like",

option to correct underlying genetic complement abnormality and prevent disease recurrenceRecommendations, that in patients with CFH or CFI genetic variants, combined liver-kidney (if there is also ESRD) or isolated liver transplant (if renal function is normal or has recovered) should be consideredNo guidelines on whether combined liver-kidney or liver alone transplants should be considered for patients with genetic variants in other complement regulatory genesLiver transplant, combined with renal or in isolation, is not widespread procedure for long-term correction and management of aHUSEculizumab and aHUSEculizumab (Soliris, Alexion) is humanized monoclonal antibody targeting terminal complement pathwayBinds with high affinity to complement protein, C5, and prevents generation of anaphylotoxin, C5a, and MAC (C5b-C9)Several studies demonstrated its efficacy in controlling complement activation in patients with aHUS pre- and post transplantationIn patients with CFH or CFI variants and aHUS, eculizumab used pre- and post transplantationDuration of administration in latter setting is unknownEculizumab is very expensiveAlternate approaches to wean off have been studied, though long-term, large cohort data are still lackingOne alternate strategy to adopt combined liver-kidney transplant in patients with ESRD, but this has substantial riskOften need intensive plasmapheresis in pre- and perioperative period to ensure optimal complement levelsStandard dosing of eculizumab for recurrent aHUS is 900 mg, IV, every week for 4 weeks, followed by 1,200 mg biweeklyDuration of eculizumab treatment has not been optimizedMany centers continue it indefinitely, but determination should be made on case-by-case basisPatients with persistent symptoms on eculizumab may also be treated with either plasmapheresis or plasma infusionEculizumab treatment carries risk for life-threatening meningococcal infections due to blockade of terminal pathway of complement activationPatients considered for eculizumab therapy should receive meningococcal vaccine at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of therapy, and, additionally, antimicrobial prophylaxis can be consideredIf urgent eculizumab therapy is indicated, antimicrobial prophylaxis can be administered simultaneouslyLaboratory Testing for Diagnosis of aHUS and Monitoring of EculizumabPatients who manifest features of HUS should be evaluated to eliminate possibility of Shiga-toxin-associated HUSADAMTS13 level and activity should also be measured to assess for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)If ADAMTS13 results are > 5-10%, then investigation for aHUS should includeSerologic (serum or plasma) measurement of AH50 (functional assessment of alternate complement pathway)C3 and C4 levelsMeasurement of FH, FI, and FB levels, FH autoantibodies, and sMAC levelsProvide measure of terminal activation of complementCD46 (MCP) expression can be measured on surface of leukocytes by flow cytometryGenetic testing for variants in complement regulatory genesShould include deletion/duplication analysis and Sanger sequencing for homologous regionsEssential for complement serologic analysis to collect and transport blood specimens appropriately for further processing and analysisDue to likelihood of in vitro complement activation and consumption by sample handlingAdditionally, split products, such as C3Bb and C4d, can also be assessed as markers of complement activationNormal range for plasma FH is large and influenced by genetic and environmental factorsChallenging to detect heterozygous FH deficiency by plasma measurementsSpecific monoclonal antibodies detect 2 allotypes of FHY402H (Tyr402His) in SCR7 domain of CFH and CFHL1Y402 and H402 utilizing common CFH SNPThis method allowsDetermination of contribution of each CFH allele, in heterozygous Y402H individuals, to total plasma FH and FHL-1 protein poolRapid and simple identification of patients carrying CFH null allelesThese patients may be missed by standard FH plasma quantitation methodsQuick assessment of impact of specific CFH variants on protein expressionEculizumab treatment can be monitored by measuring C5 protein level and C5 functionNew mass spectrometry assay that can quantify eculizumab drug, which, in conjunction with C5 level and functional monitoring, can provide insight into dosage and potential duration of administrationMay indirectly provide information on presence of antidrug antibodies in individuals who may appear refractory to therapy after prolonged use, but there is no direct way of determining thisSummaryAtypical HUS represents multifactorial etiology, which is initiated by trigger events, including infections, drugs, malignancy, transplantation, pregnancy, and autoimmune diseasesResults in endothelial cell injury and thrombi in small vesselsGenetic variants in coagulation genes, such as PLG, ADAMTS13, and DGKE, can contribute to pathology at this stageDirect lysis by MAC and thrombus formation can cause mechanical damage to erythrocytes, which, in presence of genetic variants in complement regulatory genes, e.g., CFH, CFI, C3, CFB, CD46 (MCP), or autoantibodies to FH, results in overactivation of complementaHUS can lead to ESRD, which requires treatment with either eculizumab &/or renal transplantationDuration of eculizumab treatment in individuals with genetic aHUS can be lifelong unless combined liver-kidney or liver transplant is performed in suitable patients under appropriate conditionsDecision to discontinue eculizumab treatment pre- or post renal transplantation made on case-by-case basis, depending on clinical context and genetic defectLaboratory studies can help with diagnosis of aHUS as well as monitoring of

modulate T-cell immune responsesAdvancements in transplantation immunology reveal role for B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and components of innate immune response in maintaining allograft

both acute and chronic antibody-mediated rejection (AMR)Nonimmunologic tissue damage (i.e., ischemia-reperfusion injury) and infectionsEnhance alloreactivity and promote rejection episodesMediated by production of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)Mediated by modifications of alloreactive T-cell repertoireEarly inflammatory response to tissue injury depends on adaptive immunityThis chapter briefly reviews importance of both adaptive and innate immune responses in SOTInnate Immune Responses in SOTInnate Immunity and Complement in Allograft Rejection and ToleranceInnate, antigen-independent proinflammatory events occur soon after SOTMay be regulated and enhanced by graft-specific adaptive immune responseInnate immune responses primarily mediated by PAMPs or pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs)PAMPs or PRRs recognize pathogen-derived molecules and host-derived molecules from damaged/stressed tissuesIschemic and surgical trauma can trigger release of endogenous molecules capable of activating PRRsToll-like receptors (TLRs) are important PRRs that activate innate immunity and direct adaptive immune responsesTLRs expressed on following cellsDendritic cells (DCs), B cells, mast cells, T cells, endothelial cells, organ parenchymal cellsTLR expression modulated by inflammatory mediators and other localized or systemic activation signalsTLR stimulation results in activation of key transcription factors, such as NF-κBResults in production of many mediators and augmented functionsProinflammatory cytokinesChemokinesAntimicrobial peptidesAdhesion moleculesEnhanced antigen presentationUpregulation of costimulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs)Other PRRs includeNucleotide-binding

IL-18Retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-like helicases (RLHs)Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)Scavenger receptorsComplement receptorsMannose-binding lectinInnate immune cells critical in alloantigen presentationMature, activated DCs perform many functionsSecretion of proinflammatory cytokinesUpregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II on cellsIncreased expression of T-cell costimulatory moleculesIn absence of \"danger\" signals, DCs remain immature and mediate tolerance via induction of anergy or apoptosis on cognate interaction with antigen-specific T cellsMacrophages do not effectively prime naive T cells but play key role in immediate posttransplant periodDonor and recipient macrophages infiltrate allografts and proliferateAbsolute numbers of macrophages decrease in absence of rejectionIn acute rejection, macrophage infiltration accounts for 40-60% of cellular infiltrate and performs following rolesProduction of proinflammatory cytokinesPhagocytose necrotic cell debrisProduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS)Presents antigen to effector T cellsNeutrophils also mediate tissue injury via cytotoxic and proinflammatory mechanismsNK cells are important innate lymphocytes, and while unlikely to solely mediate allograft rejection, they act as facilitators by amplifying early graft inflammation and supporting T-cell alloreactivityComplement activation, when unchecked, can result in tissue (allograft) injuryPlays key role in AMR by promoting alloantigen-specific B-cell maturation and reducing threshold for B-cell stimulation by antigensPeripheral synthesis of complement characteristic of newly transplanted organsDetermines allograft response to surgical and other stressorsContributes to T-cell priming and shaping of adaptive immune response related to transplant rejectionC3a and C5a produced by complement activation act as cofactors for antigen presentation and increase activation of naive alloreactive T cellsRoles of complementComplement triggered by binding of alloantibodies to donor organ endothelial cellsSignificant variability in endothelial cell response to pathogenic antibody and complement3 possible outcomesImmediate thrombosis and allograft infarctLesser injury with gradual decline of allograft function due to complement depositionNo injuryAll these phenomena can contribute to allograft damage and rejectionInfection, Tissue Damage, and Immune Response in SOTInfections and AlloreactivityInfections (viral) in pretransplant period can induce memory T cells that cross react with allogeneic MHC through direct allorecognition (heterologous immunity)Alloreactive memory T cells are more important in allograft rejection because ofPropensity for rapid expansionProduction of inflammatory and cytotoxic effector mediatorsPretransplant frequency of donor-specific memory T cells (producing IFN-γ) in renal transplant patients correlates with risk of posttransplant rejection episodesPosttransplant bacterial, fungal, and viral infections also associate with development of acute or chronic rejection, depending on type of SOT and infectionActivation of PRRs by infection results in eventual T-cell activation and differentiation with downstream activation of other hematopoietic cells that may participate in rejectionDifferent pathogens elicit different classes of immune responseViral and intracellular bacterial infections drive responses mediated by Th1 cells, cytotoxic CD8 T cells, and NK cellsExtracellular bacteria trigger both Th1- and Th17-mediated responsesFungal infections stimulate predominantly Th17-mediated responsesType I interferons (IFNs) produced during viral and intracellular bacterial infections and stimulate immune responsesTreatment of recurrent hepatitis C viral (HCV) infections with IFN-α in transplant patients facilitates viral clearance but increases risk of allograft rejectionBesides bystander effects of infections (via cytokines) on T-cell activation, infections directly influence uptake and presentation of alloantigensIndirect allorecognition (alloantigen uptake and presentation by recipient APC on MHC class I or II to alloreactive T cells) is crucial in late rejection (may also play role in acute rejection)Infections in allograft may facilitate more effective alloantigen presentation (via uptake of alloantigens and PAMPs in same phagosome) and promote rejectionCertain infections [e.g., Cytomegalovirus (CMV)] may have immunosuppressive effect systemically, which predisposes to opportunistic superinfectionsIncreased rate of CMV infection and reactivation of HHV6 and HHV7Course of HCV infection exacerbated by CMV preinfection in liver transplantIncreased risk (7-10x) of Epstein-Barr virus-posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (EBV-PTLD) in CMV-infected compared to noninfected transplant patientsMechanism of infection-associated immunosuppression (IS) may be related to endogenous glucocorticoid production during viral and bacterial infections, which can transiently induce systemic ISCan result in increased severity of secondary infections but also reduces alloreactivityNew therapeutic approaches focus on blocking innate immune responses that stimulate alloreactivity but not protective immunity to infectionse.g., rapamycin (sirolimus) increases magnitude and quality of effector and memory CD8 T-cell responses to infection but inhibits alloreactive CD8 T-cell responsesDanger Signals and Role in SOTPAMPs allow innate recognition of invading pathogensDAMPs also activate innate immunity via recognition of endogenous cellular stress \"danger\" signalsDAMPs can be subclassified based on physiologic presence and propertiesIntracellular molecules, including nucleic acids, and heat-shock proteins (HSPs)Not accessible normally to immune systemOnly released into extracellular environment or expressed on cell surface after cell damageExtracellular molecules, including extracellular matrix components, altered by cellular stress or injuryProcess of organ harvesting and transplantation alone can generate DAMPs and activate innate immunityMost DAMPs signal through TLRs, resulting in NF-κB activation and activation of inflammatory response genes, production of inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil recruitment, preparation of APC, and upregulation of costimulatory molecules and MHCDue to pivotal role of TLRs in organ transplantation process and outcomes, defects in TLR signaling could improve transplant successDemonstrated in lung recipients and liver and kidney transplant donors who had loss-of-function (LOF) TLR4 polymorphismOther than TLRs, DAMPs also signal through non-PRRs, e.g., ligation of RAGE, which can act in concert with TLR activation to modulate inflammatory responseDAMPs can drive fibrosis-based tissue restructuring in allograft; generate different downstream signals compared to PAMPsEffect of DAMPs on rates of rejection and graft dysfunction provide avenues for therapeutic interventionEither via decreasing DAMP expression, enhancing clearance, or blocking signalingImportant DAMPs in SOT, depending on transplant organ: HMGB1, ATP, HSPs, nucleic acids, heparan sulfate, hyaluronan, fibronectin, haptoglobinSome like haptoglobin and heparan sulfate are relevant in specific organs, e.g., heart and kidney respectively, while most other DAMPs are relevant for multiple organsNK Cells and Immune Response in SOTNK-Cell-Mediated Responses in Rejection and ToleranceActivated NK-cell production of IFN-γ augments early adaptive immune responsesNK-produced IFN-γ postulated to provide costimulation to antigen-experienced T cellsNK cells serve as bridge between innate and adaptive immunity in rejectionNK-activating receptors, such as NKG2D, promote rejection by recognition of activating ligands on allograftsMature DCs resist NK-mediated cytotoxicity through upregulation of MHC class IResult in enhanced Th1-specific allogeneic responses by selecting mature DCsImmature DCs eliminated by NK-cell killingCounterpoint to NK-cell function in rejection is their role in tolerance inductionBoth activating and inhibitory NK-cell receptors required for mediating toleranceSecretion of IL-10 in response to infection is example of NK-cell regulation in systemic inflammationIL-10 is immunoregulatory cytokine and key host factor in inducing and maintaining T-cell exhaustion and facilitating viral persistenceIn chronically infected HCV patients, NK cells produce both IL-10 and IFN-γNK-cell regulation of immune response requires both cytotoxicity and cytokine productionNK-cell immune responses regulated in turn by TregsTGF-β produced by Tregs suppresses cytotoxic profile of NK cells, inhibits granzyme A and B and CD16 expression, and downregulates activating receptor, NKG2DDepletion of Tregs enhances NK-cell proliferation and cytotoxicityUnique role of NK cells determine if downstream T-cell response skews toward tolerance or rejection based on their effector functionB-Cell Immune Responses in SOTAcute and Chronic Antibody-Mediated Rejection and ImmunosuppressionRole of donor-specific alloantibodies (DSA) well established in allograft rejectionNon-donor-specific HLA antibodies reported and appear earlier compared to DSAWeaning IS or homeostatic repopulation after immune cell depletion can lower threshold for B-cell activationMay facilitate DSA production, C4d (+) injury, and chronic rejectionSeveral commonly used transplant immunosuppression (IS) agents influence B-cell activation and DSA production to varying degreesAlemtuzumab, monoclonal anti-CD52 antibody when used as induction agent, especially in absence of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) ISCauses B-cell suppression for 3-12 monthsBut associates with increased incidence of AMR in patients with preformed DSABelatacept, CTLA4 fusion proteinBinds CD80/CD86Blocks interaction with CD28 (inhibiting T-cell costimulation)Decreases incidence of de novo alloantibody productionBortezomib, proteasome inhibitorShown in early studies to reverse AMR and decrease DSA after plasmapheresisAdditional studies

signaling of these cytokinesActivation of NF-κB (2nd wave)This round of NF-κB upregulates effector molecules (IL-8, MCP-1)Attracts leukocytes to site of inflammationPromotes tissue injury (release of ROS)T-cell activation through T-cell receptor signals NF-κB activation and eventually IL2 gene transcription and T-cell proliferationAlloantigen recognition and T-cell activation in allograft rejection includesDirect (intact donor HLA presenting \"normal\" antigen to recipient T cells) pathwayIndirect (alloantigen presentation by recipient DCs) pathwayNF-κB activation via canonical pathway also critical for thymic generation of natural Tregs, which suppresses allograft immune responses and prolongs allograft survivalCanonical pathway for NF-kB activation includes induction by physiologic NF-κB stimuli and represented by TNFR1 signaling through binding of TRADD and recruitment of FADD and TRAF2IκBα phosphorylated in IKKβ- and NEMO-dependent manner, resulting in nuclear translocation of p65-containing heterodimersAnimal model data suggests that NF-κB may be important for Treg development but inhibitory for Treg functionInhibition of upstream molecule of NF-κB pathway

peripheral development of TregsNF-κB role in alloimmunity suggests specific blocking of T-cell NF-κB may prevent allograft rejectionNF-κB appears to be viable therapeutic target in transplantationRisk:benefit ratio has to be assessed and toxicity of such therapies reducedFor more immunogenic transplanted organs, additional or alternate therapies may be needed since allograft rejection can take place in context of NF-κB-impaired T cellsImmunosuppressive Therapy in SOTModulation of Immune ResponseIS in current era primarily antibody based (but CNI and mTOR inhibitors also used)Both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies used to prevent and treat allograft rejectionReduces incidence of acute rejection episodesImproves short- and long-term graft survival but increased risk for both opportunistic infections and posttransplant malignanciesIS used to target or control 1 or more of 3 alloimmune response phases (signal 1-3)Induction IS based on type of SOT: 70-80% of SOT use induction with exception of liver transplant; only 20% of liver transplants use inductionImmune response in SOT can be summarized in 3-signal modelSignal 1: Initiation of T-cell activation by alloantigen presentation on MHC class II by APCsSignal 2: Expansion of T-cell activation with costimulatory signals (CD80/CD86 interaction with CD28)Signal 3: Culmination of T-cell activation with stimulation of calcium-calcineurin pathwayResults in production of IL-2 by activated T cellsIL-2 binds IL-2R on activated T cells and triggers mTORInduces T-cell proliferation and further cytokine productionIS regimens typically consist of triple drug-maintenance therapy acting at different levels of immune response cascadeInduction agents act at signal 1 by effacing lymphocyte depletion (e.g., ATG, alemtuzumab)CNI and IL-2R antagonists act at signal 1 and 3 (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus)Inhibit cytokine production and IL-2-mediated activation of mTORAntiproliferative agents [e.g., mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), azathioprine] act downstream of signal 3Inhibit purine synthesis and work in concert with mTOR inhibitors (e.g., sirolimus)Inhibits T-cell proliferationCostimulation inhibitors (e.g., belatacept) act on signal 2Block binding of CD80 and CD86 to CD28 receptorSummaryManipulation of Immune Response in SOTSuccess of allotransplantation depends on optimizing IS to curb

over- and under-IS, and each has consequencesOverimmunosuppresion can lead toSignificant infectionsMalignancy with increased morbidity and mortalityDecreased IS can result in allograft rejection in absence of active immune tolerancePersonalized IS remains \"holy grail\" of transplantationImmunosuppressive regimens in SOT divided into induction and maintenance ISCurrent standards based on pharmacokinetic (PK) monitoring of IS to achieve therapeutic targetsDoes not necessarily correlate with immune functionIdeal includes both pharmacodynamic (PD) and PK monitoringUniform analytical framework for PD has yet to be establishedImmune monitoringOffers systematic and thoughtful approach to PD evaluation on individual patient basisEncompasses complete assessment of immunologic function following use of immunomodulatory agentsInvolves use of laboratory assays typically offered in high-complexity clinical immunology laboratoriesFuture approach for effective IS management is immunologic instead of pharmacologic titrationMultiple biomarkers available to measure immune functionReflect donor-specific and non-donor-specific immune activation states in transplant recipients, pre- and postinitiation of ISBiomarkers can be broadly differentiated into soluble or cellular markersAssociated with rejection (immune activation)Associated with immune toleranceDefining potential therapeutic targetsLaboratory Approaches to Immune MonitoringFlow Cytometric Immunophenotyping to Monitor Induction Therapies in Solid Organ TransplantationMajority of induction approaches involve T-cell manipulation via direct depletion [i.e., antithymocyte globulin (ATG)] &/or functional suppression; minority involve B-cell-depleting/suppressive agents (i.e., rituximab)Evaluation of T-cell counts to adjust induction therapy for each patient is criticalPermits appropriate use of induction agent doseHowever, this approach is not always practiced, which results in use of varied and sometimes empirical protocolsRabbit or horse ATG polyclonal antibody used frequently for T-cell depletion in induction strategiesATG also depletes non-T cells (B and NK cells) in dose-dependent fashion, typically at higher dosesRituximabChimeric monoclonal antibody against CD20 that preferentially labels CD20 (+) B cells for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)BasiliximabChimeric monoclonal antibody against IL-2 Rα (CD25), which blocks IL-2 mediation autocrine T-cell proliferation with downstream consequences on other immune componentsAbsolute lymphocyte count (ALC) from CBC/differential often used to determine overall immune status in transplant patientsCan have normal ALC with significant numerical \"alterations\" in lymphocyte subsets: T cells [CD3, CD4, and CD8 (+)], B cells [CD19 (+)], and NK cells [CD16, CD56 (+)]Lymphopenia in one subset can be associated with homeostatic expansion of other subset(s)Quantitative skewing of individual lymphocyte subsets only determined by flow cytometryLymphocyte subset quantitation influenced byDiurnal variationStressHigh-intensity exerciseSleep patternsFor ideal serial monitoring of lymphocyte subsets, collect sample within same time window to prevent misinterpretation of results due to above factorsQuantitation of lymphocyte subsets allows accurate measurement of specific subset counts following induction therapyLymphocyte subset analysis to titrate IS prevents other consequences of over-IS, e.g., hypogammaglobulinemia due to B-cell depletion with ATGHypogammaglobulinemia in SOTAssociated with increased risk of opportunistic infections (< 6 months post transplant)Follows augmented IS for rejection episodesAssessed post induction and during maintenance IS by immunoglobulin quantitation (IgG, IgA, and IgM isotypes)Enables replacement immunoglobulin therapy to manage severe hypogammaglobulinemia and ameliorate consequences of recurrent infectionsOther immunophenotyping assays include quantitation of regulatory T cells (Tregs), naive, memory, activated, senescent, and exhausted T cells, B-cell, NK-cell, monocyte, and dendritic cell (DC) subsetsNaive vs. memory and activated T cells can be useful to predict risk of rejection &/or infectionSenescent and exhausted T cells can identify states of chronic antigenic stimulation and potential nonresponsivenessInterpretation of quantitative immunophenotyping data, e.g., Treg or T-cell subsets, during serial monitoring must account for changes in parent T-cell populations [CD4 and CD8 (+)] due to alteration in immunosuppressive therapy over timeIf IS changes during time interval of immune monitoring, any change in total CD4 (+) and CD8 (+) T-cell counts can potentially affect both relative frequencies (%) and absolute counts of various T-cell or Treg subsetsSoluble biomarkersCytokines, such as IL-6, sIL-2Rα, IL-8, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-18, IL-10, IL-17, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13Differential expression of these cytokines based on clinical context and resulting immune responseChemokines, such as CXCL9 and CXCL10Elevated levels in settings of inflammation, particularly mediated by IFN-γExpressed by T cells and innate immune cells, including NK cells, neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, eosinophils, and mast cellsUrinary CXCL9 and CXCL10Clinically validated in multicenter observational study, including of adult and pediatric kidney transplant recipientsInflammation secondary to BK virus (BKV) infection or urinary tract infectionMay increase urinary secretion of chemokines, so holistic, clinical, and laboratory assessment required to diagnose allograft rejectionLimited studies in liver and lung transplant recipients show elevated levels in early allograft dysfunctionComplement mediators and byproducts of complement activationNo standardized protocols exist for routine monitoring of cytokines and chemokines in

and adaptive immune cellsLoss of HLA-DR expression on CD14 (++) (bright) monocytes or expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) can associate with state of \"immune paralysis\"Tolerogenic

SOTActivated T cells [CD4 (+) &/or CD8 (+)] expressing HLA-DR, &/or CD25 (+), &/or CD38 (+) can provide quantitative information on T-cell activation in context of allograft rejection &/or infectionTregs expressing FOXP3 and Helios [also expressing CD25 (++) and CD127 (-)] quantitatively decreased in blood during states of acute rejection compared to patients with immune toleranceImportant to note that FOXP3 expression on CD4 (+), CD25 (++), and CD127 (-) T cells, does not automatically identify Tregs as activated conventional T cells can also transiently express FOXP3Helios is transcription factor expressed in large proportion of thymic-derived FOXP3 (+) TregsHelios (+) Tregs have more activated phenotype and slightly higher suppressive capacity in vitro with more highly demethylated Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR)However, quantitation of Helios (+) Tregs or assessment of methylation status of TSDR does not automatically define extent of Treg suppressor functionExpression of PD-1 (+) and Tim-3 (+) on activated [HLA-DR (+)] or memory [CD45RO (+)] T cells indicates T-cell exhaustion due to chronic antigenic stimulationExpression of CD57 (+) &/or loss of CD28 (+) on CD4 (+) &/or CD8 (+) T cells is marker of T-cell senescenceT effector memory reexpressing CD45RA (TEMRA) cells is heterogenous subset that can also correlate with cellular senescence, but these cells can retain antiviral immunityIncrease in CD57 (+) and CD4 (+) T cells pretransplant may identify individuals who can be treated with Belatacept to manage allograft rejectionGlobal Functional Immune AnalysisImmunophenotyping and quantitation of lymphocyte subsets allows rapid adjustments in induction ISFunctional analysis also important for immune monitoringPreservation of numerical integrity of lymphocyte subsets (whether by ALC analysis or flow cytometry) does not necessarily correlate with functional immune competenceSOT patients with normal ALC can have significantly impaired T-cell functionPatients with reduced ALC can have relatively more preserved functionCommonly used measurements for global T-cell functionAssessment of lymphocyte proliferation to mitogenic stimuliImpaired proliferative responses to mitogens, such as phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or anti-CD3Less sensitive but more specific test for abnormal T-cell functionPHA stimulates T cells regardless of antigenic specificityNote that mitogen-based T-cell proliferation assays do not reflect physiologic T-cell activationEvaluation of antigen-specific T-cell responses considered more sensitive but less specific indicator of impaired T-cell functionAnti-CD3 and anti-CD28 costimulation offers more physiologic alternative to PHA while remaining global in specificityMethodology of T-cell proliferation assays affects interpretation of resultsFlow cytometry is ideal method, but most labs use tritiated thymidine (radioactive marker)Flow cytometric assays offer better resolution than radioactive method in patients with T-cell lymphopenia, and are unaffected by cellular dilutionT-cell activation by analysis of cytokine productionWhen activated, CD4 (+) and CD8 (+) T cells typically produce various cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α) in temporally regulated manner (polyfunctional T cells)Assays (ImmuKnow) measuring proliferation with PHA for shorter time periods using purified T cells [CD3 (+), CD4 (+), or CD8 (+)] and surrogate markers for cellular DNA synthesis risk underestimating T-cell proliferative responseTypically, 3 days required for evaluating maximal proliferative responseMay result in false assessment of T-cell functionNo linear correlation between magnitude of decreased proliferative response to mitogens and degree of immune compromiseSingle numerical value or range to determine T-cell functional competence is more likely to be misleading than informativeFunctional immune competence has many componentsNo single assay can be used for this purposeNK-cell functionMeasured by flow cytometry or radioactive label assays for spontaneous NK cytotoxicity, cytokine-stimulated cytotoxicity (lymphokine-activated killer), and ADCCCellular degranulation also used to measure CD8 (+) T-cell and NK-cell functionDegranulation assay involves flow cytometric measurement of CD107a/b [proteins expressed on surface of intracellular cytotoxic granules present in CD8 (+) T cells and NK cells]Activation of CD8 (+) T cells and NK cells by mitogen or specific antigen results in cytotoxic granule migration intracellularly to cell surfaceGranule membrane merges with cell membrane, exposing CD107a/b proteinsCD107a/b proteins become extracellular on activation and can be detected by specific antibodies using flow cytometryDoes not necessarily correlate with cytotoxic activityCytotoxic function dependent on cytotoxic granule content and concentration of cytolytic proteins rather than degranulation processB-cell function

applicability across multiple solid organsAge-specific reference intervals have yet to be establishedNot widely used for transplant immune monitoringLab-Based Immune Monitoring of Virus-Specific ResponsesGeneral ApproachHallmark of severe functional T-cell compromise is presence of opportunistic infections, including viral infection or reactivationRisk of CMV and EBV based on serological analysis (virus-specific IgM and IgG antibodies) to determine exposure in both donor and recipient and molecular methods (PCR) to determine viral load (copy number) in SOT recipientMolecular (PCR-based) methods used to determine viral load (copy number) at time of active infectionTo screen for PTLD, monitoring EBV DNAemia in whole blood may be followed by screening plasma compartment, once EBV is detectedBKV seroprevalence90% in American adultsPresence of BKV-specific binding antibodies does not predict risk of posttransplant reactivationBK antibody testing should not be used routinely as part of pretransplant screeningViral antigen- or culture-based methods are less commonly employed during active infectionViral culture useful for antiviral susceptibility testingEssential to evaluate host (recipient) immune response to determine risk for infection and competence to handle pathogen in case of exposure, either from preexisting latent virus or posttransplant infectionAssays of Cellular Competence to VirusesMost cellular assays focus on virus-specific CD8 (+) T-cell quantitation and functional analysis using cytokine readoutsAntigen-specific T cells should be present and competent to elicit antiviral responseFunctional status can be ascertained by flow cytometryInvolves peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) stimulation by virus-specific peptide(s)Followed by measurement of IFN-γ (marker of CD8 T-cell activation) &/or CD107a/b (marker of cytotoxic cellular degranulation)Quality control for assaysRequires assessment of positive and negative controlPositive controlStimulation with mitogen (PHA, staphylococcal enterotoxin B) to evaluate global T-cell responseMeasurable response above threshold needed for results to be interpretableLack thereof may reflect T-cell anergy or HLA class mismatchNegative controlStimulation with nonspecific antigen or medium (tissue culture) to evaluate baseline T-cell reactivityShould not elicit specific T-cell responseCMV-specific cellular assaysCommercially available as laboratory-developed tests (LDTs)Limited use due to provider practice and absence of robust analytical

measurement of CD107a/b and IFN-γCMV-TIC score ranges from 0-5Scores of 0-2: Consistent with ineffective CMV-specific CD8 (+) T-cell response to specific MHC-peptide combination with evidence of tissue-invasive disease, prolonged viremia duration, and increased CMV reinfection risk in SOT patientsAssay limitationsMHC tetramer reagents limit epitope specificity of antigenic peptides used in assay to those peptides with high affinity for specific MHC alleles\"Immunodominant\" peptides that bind with high affinity to most common HLA types most frequently used in commercial assaysBroader peptide coverage necessitates more tetramer combinations, leading to increased expenseTetramer-based flow cytometric quantitation of antigen-specific CD8 (+) T cells requires a priori knowledge of HLA

rejection and operational toleranceTorque Teno Virus-Based AssaysBased on premise that viral kinetics may act as surrogate marker of net state of ISViral replication in host is tightly controlled by intricate interplay of immune system, particularly T cells, which are also primary target of induction and maintenance ISAny changes to IS that quantitatively or qualitatively affect T cells would result in change in torque teno virus (TTV) loadTTV is apathogenic, negative-sense, circular single-stranded DNA virus that makes up ~ 70% of human viromeReplicates in all PBMCs, preferentially T

compared to healthy individualsUtility as functional biomarkerDegree of IS, based on pharmacologic titration, is correlated with level of DNAemiaInduction IS is associated with higher level of TTV DNAemia, although, with this lymphotropic virus, there is delay in rate of virologic replication following T-cell depletionPatients receiving triple maintenance IS have higher TTV load compared to those receiving dual ISAssociation with infection remains inconclusive based on statistically significant and insignificant results that vary by studyRelation to allograft status: Current evidence is insufficient for clinical correlationTTV-POET trial reported log10 increase in TTV load decreased odds for allograft rejection by 22%Using cutoff of 1.5 × 10^6 copies/mL carried 89% specificity and 36% sensitivityStudy concluded that TTV load ranging from 1 × 10^6 to 1 × 10^8 copies/mL would minimize risk of rejection and infectionLevels of TTV DNAemia, unlike other viruses, are relatively stable over time in individualsIn large study of SOT recipients, viral load peaked by 3 months post transplant, then maintained steady state with fluctuations < 1 log10 copies/mLDNAemia not skewed by current antivirals; none known to have activity against TTVLimitationsChanges in baseline TTV viral load relative to age and sex make it hard to define cutoff value above which DNAemia is clinically

ToleranceImmunologic unresponsiveness specifically directed to donor allograft without exogenous immunosuppressionImmunologic tolerance can be either complete (full) or partialFull tolerance involves indefinite existence of donor allograft without any extrinsic immunosuppression and intact immune function, including pathogen response and immune surveillanceAchieved typically by induction of donor

HCTAvailability of donor organs relative to preparative regimen for HCTRequirement for hematopoietic source and solid organ from same living donorPartial tolerance requires maintenance of allograft

biomarkers or assays needed to determine immunologic tolerance, whether achieved through full or partial approachInvasive biopsies not suitable for regular (daily/weekly) monitoring of graft statusIdeal biomarkers measured by non- or minimally invasive methods (blood or urine)Biomarkers for operational tolerance described for liver and renal transplantation; however, very different between 2 organsTo determine tolerance induction in liver transplantation (LT), NK-cell proportions and gene transcripts, as well as γδ T-cell levels and transcripts, suggested as biomarkers in

of biomarkers in transplant patientsAdditional data required for widespread use of these biomarkers in assessment of operational tolerance in liver and renal transplantationIdentification of markers for operational tolerance also requires markers for early identification of graft rejectionBiomarkers need validation for identification of patients with operational tolerance in whom immunosuppression can be minimized or withdrawnFrom clinical perspective, immunosuppressive drug-weaning or withdrawal approaches should not be initiated without robust assessment of extant immune toleranceInduction of Transplant Tolerance in Clinical PracticeWeaning off immunosuppression or active tolerance induction protocols not commonplace in routine clinical practiceOngoing clinical trials studying adoptive cellular therapies as well as drug therapies for achieving transplant toleranceSafety evaluation (phase I/II) of \"tolerance-inducing\" adoptive immunotherapy in renal transplantation (Treg subsets, tolerogenic macrophages, and tolerogenic recipient-derived DCs) has been initiated with multicenter \"The ONE Study\"Use of Regulatory Cell Therapies in Clinical PracticeCellular therapeutic options not routinely available to treat rejection or graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD); however, several in pipeline for evaluationPotential regulatory cells used therapeutically in organ transplantation are Tregs, regulatory macrophages, tolerogenic DCs, MDSCs, and MSCsNoncellular approaches to boost Treg function, using drug or immunomodulatory therapies, includeDelaying use of CNIsAlternatively, other immunosuppression protocols avoiding use of CNIsUse of immunomodulatory agents, which primarily deplete, e.g., alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody) or polyclonal antithymocyte globulinOther biological agents, such as mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin, everolimus) or T-cell costimulation/activation blockers (belatacept, abatacept)Regulatory macrophages isolated from donor allografts administered to 2 living donor renal transplant recipients, showing no adverse effects on allograft functionCNI therapy reduced within 6 months of transplantationOther regulatory macrophage therapy studies performed in small numbers of renal transplant patients, including those receiving deceased donor organsMSCs, typically derived from adipose tissue, or, less frequently, bone marrow or umbilical cord, used with positive early outcomes in kidney transplantationIncluding decreased incidence of acute rejection, reduction in opportunistic infections, and sustained allograft function at 1-year post transplantRespond differently in various physiologic contexts, e.g.,In noninflammatory settings, MSCs promote tissue regeneration and repair and do not exacerbate immunogenicityIn presence of inflammatory cytokines, MSCs are highly immunosuppressive and express MHC, allowing effective allograft toleranceSeveral clinical trials of MSCs in solid organ transplantationMost in kidney but also single trials in lung, liver, and islet cellPreliminary results encouraging but need additional studies to ensure optimal outcomes while maximizing patient safetyMSCs, by definition, are adherent cells that express CD105, CD73, CD90Lack expression of CD45, CD34, CD14, CD11b, CD79-α, MHC class IIShould be capable of pluripotency and differentiate under appropriate conditions to different cell line lineagesSince MSCs preferentially home to sites of vascular damage or inflammation, they may mitigate toxic effects of ischemia-reperfusion injury, which can trigger innate and adaptive immune responseHCT used successfully to achieve immunologic tolerance in patients receiving living donor renal transplantsStable complete or mixed chimerism can allow long-term maintenance (3 months to > 10 years) of allograft without need for exogenous immunosuppressionHowever, mixed chimerism more favorable at reducing GVHD than complete chimerismChimerism seems essential for induction of tolerance but not maintenanceChronic rejection can appear in patients with transient mixed chimerism indicating that, without stable chimerism, there will be loss of immunologic tolerance with timeSummaryRegulation of immune responses and processes is complex phenomenon, involving many different cellular subsets and mechanismsCareful monitoring of transplant patients over time may benefit identification of type of cellular therapy to use and best time in transplant process for cellular therapy intervention",

responses to specific viruses in SOTInnate Immunity in Antiviral ResponseInnate immune defenses prevent initial viral infection before mobilization of adaptive immune responseInitiated by pathogen

(NLRs)RIG-like receptors (RLRs)DExD/H box RNA helicasesRNA helicases recognize cytoplasmic viral productsPRRs promote expression of interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokinesType I (α/β) IFNs block viral replication byInhibiting cellular protein synthesisActivating NK cellsIndirectly producing interleukin-12 (IL-12)Inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, IL-23, transforming growth factor-β, chemokines) regulate inflammatory response against virusesViral invasion inhibited byAntibodiesComplementChemokines, such as macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1αVirus-infected cells phagocytosed by macrophages or neutrophils, or undergo cytolysis by NK cells, γ/δ T cells, and nitric oxideNK cells activated by inhibitory (lectin-like heterodimers) and activating receptors (natural cytotoxicity receptors or viral peptide-loaded MHC molecules) on virus-infected cellsAdaptive Immunity in Antiviral ResponseChemokines and cytokines produced by innate immune response activate secondary adaptive immune response consisting of humoral and predominantly cellular componentsHumoral response mediated by antibodies that neutralize free viral particles in extracellular environment and prevent viral reactivation or reinfectionCellular response executed by T cells that recognize and lyse virus-infected cells to limit active viral replication and ongoing infectionDendritic cells present viral antigens in lymph nodes immediately downstream from infection site or spleen in setting of viremiaWithin B-cell follicles of lymph nodes, B-cell activation leads toDevelopment of short-lived plasma cellsRequires upregulation of transcription factors, such as B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein (Blimp)-1X-box binding protein (XBP)-1Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-4Secrete virus-specific, low-affinity antibodiesIgM isotypeSelection of memory B cells through affinity maturation (somatic hypermutation and isotype class switching)Subset differentiates

cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs)Typically activated by MHC class I-peptide antigen complexes on dendritic cells or other antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in lymph nodeRequire presence of costimulatory molecules and inflammatory cytokinesResults in development of functional effector lymphocytesFunctional effector lymphocytes circulate through bloodstream95% destroy virus-infected host cells after which these T cells undergo activation-induced cell deathVirus-infected cells may undergo apoptosis via perforins, granzymes, or engagement of Fas ligand (CTL) to Fas (virus-infected cell)Virus may be purged by virus-infected cell through assistance of chemokines produced by CTLs, such as IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, lymphotoxin (LT)-α, and RANTES, which are regulated upon activationMinority (~ 5%) differentiate into central memory cells (Tcm, primarily residing in lymph nodes)Can proliferate and rapidly differentiate into effector memory cells (Tem, mainly in peripheral circulation), capable of neutralizing virus on reexposureCD4 (+) T cells typically activated by MHC class II-peptide antigen complexes on APCs in lymph node and result in development ofT-helper cells (Th) mediate B-cell and CD8 (+) T-cell virus-specific responsesTh1 cells regulate inflammatory response by producingIFN-γLT-αTNF-αIL-2Th2 cells downregulate protective function of Th1

of Tem, which reexpress CD45RA (TEMRA)HeterogeneousCan represent senescent T-cell poolMay retain antiviral responsesCD8 (+) TEMRA more frequent in blood than CD4 (+) TEMRADegree of expansion may reflect underlying immune anomaly, relative to patient ageImmunologic memory refers to antigen-specific lymphocyte pool that expands upon viral reexposure to prevent reinfectionHumoral memory sustained by switched memory B cells, marginal zone B cells (depending on antigen), and long-lived plasma cells within bone marrow, which maintain low levels of circulating antigen-specific antibodiesCellular (T-cell) memory sustained by IL-7 receptor-α (IL-7Rα)-expressing effector cellsIL-7 and IL-15 prolong memory T-cell survival and proliferation, respectivelyOnce activated by viral reexposure, memory T cells expand and acutely mitigate rapid viral clearanceChronically proliferate, providing larger pool of memory T cellsViral Evasion of Host Immune ResponseViral pathogens utilize several mechanisms to evade detection by immune system, such asImpede antigen presentation and processing by APCs, including delayed maturation of dendritic cells [e.g., Herpesviridae (CMV, EBV), HPV]Prevent recognition of APCs by NK cells or effector lymphocytes (e.g., HIV, Herpesviridae)Inhibit apoptosis of virus-infected host cells, including T cells (e.g., HIV, adenovirus)Impairment or inhibition of cytokines, chemokines, and complement (e.g., HIV, Herpesviridae)Rapid antigenic variation via acquisition of mutations (e.g., influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2)Infection of immune-privileged sites, such asCNSEyesTestes (e.g., measles, Herpesviridae)Immune exhaustion (e.g., hepatitis B and C virus)Immune evasion by CMVEncode proteins that modulate inflammatory response to promote viral

weeks following transplantation but not several months post transplantUnclear if allo-cross-reactive memory T cells become exhausted, senescent, or undergo deletion in response to allograft

antiviral treatment against HCVHCV-associated HI may conversely result in suppression of alloimmune response through immune exhaustion and promote transplant toleranceViral Infection and Allograft RejectionAugmented immunosuppression to treat T-cell- or antibody-mediated allograft rejection increases host vulnerability to viruses by inhibiting or depleting antiviral cellular response or limiting neutralization of virions by antibodiesConversely, no in vitro evidence to date linking viral infection directly to T-cell- or antibody-mediated allograft rejectionIn response to viral reactivation or viral infection, decrease in immunosuppression may potentiate allograft sensitizationIndirectly resulting in allograft rejectionCMV DNAemia correlated with upregulation of adhesion molecules on infected allograft cells promoting infiltration and local inflammation by NK and T cellsFurther potentiated by uninfected bystander allograft cellsUpregulate MHC class I to recruit cytotoxic CD8 (+) T cellsBKV infection results in kidney allograft injury, promoting local inflammation and tubular atrophyHerpesviridae and Secondary Hemophagocytic LymphohistiocytosisHerpesviridae, particularly EBV (20%) and CMV, are common infectious triggers of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)Exact mechanism not well understoodPathway culminates with continued T-cell stimulation by antigen-presenting cellsResults in uncontrolled T-cell activation, proliferation, and hypercytokinemia leading to tissue damage and hyperinflammatory stateSpecific inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) predispose to EBV infection, resulting in HLH or malignancye.g., loss-of-function (LOF) variants in MAGT1, ITK, CD27, CD70, CTPS1, RASGRP1, CARMIL2, among others2022 EULAR/ACR criteria provide updated evidence-based clinical and laboratory characteristics for HLH and related disordersExcessive hyperinflammation is spectrum, and clinical and laboratory data must be interpreted in integrated mannerHLH-like inflammatory presentation may occur in many clinical contexts, including viral sepsisProgression to hyperinflammatory state requires acute precipitators/environmental triggers and underlying host risk factorsCD38 (+)/HLA-DR (+)-activated CD8 (+) T cells, type II IFN signature, CXCL9, sIL2R are valuable biomarkers to diagnose HLH, regardless of primary or secondary originThough hyperferritinemia is nonspecific, in context of elevated biomarkers, pretest probability (Bayes theorem) of HLH/hyperinflammation will be increasedEBV and Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative DisorderPosttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD): Devastating complication of EBV infection in SOT; majority are B-cell neoplasia within 1st year post transplant (early PTLD)Risk factors for early EBV-PTLD includePrimary EBV infectionType of organ transplantUse of T-cell- or lymphocyte-depleting agentsAge of recipient (pediatric)CMV mismatch or active diseaseRapidly increasing EBV DNAemiaChronic EBV DNAemiaEBV is promiscuous in its cellular targets (B, T, NK, monocytes, etc.)B cells are most common cell subset infected by EBVPathophysiology of EBV-PTLD involves impaired T-cell responsesImmunosuppression targeting T cells in transplant recipients hampers EBV-directed antiviral response compared to immunocompetent hostsEBV establishes latency in host B lymphocytes after prior exposure or donor B lymphocytes retained in allograft of seronegative transplant recipientsUnchecked EBV proliferation and resultant constitutive activation of B-cell reservoir leads to malignant transformationHighly associated with variations in inhibitory HLA-E/LMP-1/NKG2A pathway: EBV strains encoding for LMP-1 variants and host expression of HLA-E*0103/0103LMP-1 variant epitopes, GGDPHLPTL or GGDPPLPTL, potently inhibit NKG2A (+) NK and CD8(+) T-cellsHLA-E*0103/0103 prevents viral dissemination in vitro, which protects against infectious mononucleosis, but is overexpressed in EBV (+) PTLD patientsUtilization of Immune-Competent Cells to Control Viral infection in Solid Organ TransplantationAdoptive ImmunotherapyEmploys virus-specific functional T cells (VSTs) from uninfected donor to combat viral infection in infected transplant recipientWhole blood obtained from donor, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are isolatedPBMCs stimulated ex vivo with peptides (or peptide mixtures) that reflect antigenic epitopes specific to target virusPBMC cultures additionally supported by cytokines to promote T-cell expansion ex vivoQuality control performed and cellular product assessed for functional viability and alloreactivity of T cellsOn obtaining optimal IFN-γ response to viral antigen, product intravenously infused into infected transplant recipientMay be donor derived (allograft donor) or 3rd party (healthy adult volunteers)Must be HLA matchedCloser HLA matching obtained from donor-derived productVirologic response may take 2-4 weeksVirus-specific T-cell therapies in clinical practice: Efficacy reported in refractory viral infections in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) but limited studies conducted in SOTAgainst BKV3 patients with BKV viremia, hemorrhagic cystitis, or BKPV-associated nephropathy after transplant with complete response (33%) or partial response (67%)Complete response defined as undetectable viral load (PCR) within 4-week period after last VST infusion, or resolution of hemorrhagic cystitis and no clinical cystitis symptomsPartial response defined as > 50% reduction in viral load (PCR) within 4-week period following VST infusion, or reduction of hemorrhagic cystitis by ≥ 1 grade and associated clinical symptomsAgainst CMVIndications for CMV VST include refractory DNAemia, DNAemia with end-organ disease, including hepatitis and pneumonitisDecrease in viral load (PCR) noted in all VST recipientsCohort of 13 adult SOT patients (renal, lung, and heart) noted virologic response in 85% of VST recipientsWell tolerated with stable allograft functionAgainst EBVPrimarily used in patients with EBV-driven malignancies, such as PTLDCohort of adult SOT recipients received EBV-VSTs for refractory or high-risk EBV (+) PTLDAll patients received chemotherapy and rituximab (CD20-based B-cell depletion) prior to VSTsComplete virologic response achieved in 40% of patients prior to administration of VSTs; remainder (3 patients) achieved complete response following VSTComplete response defined as clearance of EBV DNAemiaPartial response defined as decrease in viral load by 1 log10Current gold standard uses pharmacologic agents and biologic therapies (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) to control viral infection &/or manage end-organ diseaseCellular therapies used often as adjunct therapy or last resort for refractory viral infectionQuestions utility of early intervention in SOT to prevent progression to organ involvement and systemic diseasePrimary concern for early deployment of cellular therapies is risk for allosensitization and cost and logistics involvedUnclear if cellular therapy is superior to conventional antiviral treatmentsNeed well-designed clinical trialsSummaryImpact of Viral Infections on Immune Response in Solid Organ TransplantationCoordinated effort between innate and adaptive immune system required to combat viral infectionLack of functional innate immunity, particularly NK cells, can result in viral invasion of host cellsAbsence of functional effector lymphocytes allows ongoing viral replication and persistenceAside from inadequate immune response, viruses may also manipulate components of virus-host interaction to evade detection by APCs, T cells, and NK cellsCertain viruses elicit strong inflammatory milieu that results in systemic immune dysregulation and lead to hyperinflammatory states (e.g., HLH) or malignancy (e.g., PTLD)Advances in cellular therapies enable use of VSTs to manage viral infection in transplant recipients with dampened cellular responses",
