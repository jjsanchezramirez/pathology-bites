to different standard of validation by CLIA regulationsAdditional performance parameters must be assessedPurpose of method validationAssess degree of uncertainty in measurements made by assayPoint out assay weaknesses and potential for errorAccuracy is usually validated by running standards of known concentrations and comparing measured concentration as percentage of expected concentrationPrecision or reproducibility (inter-run) is generally assessed by running at least 2 levels of analyte in quadruplicate over 5 daysPrecision is expressed as % CV ([mean/SD] x 100%)Reportable range is established by running increasing concentrations of analyte and choosing range of concentrations in which instrument response increases﻿ linearly﻿ with analyte concentrationLinear regression procedure is usually usedQC samples must be assayed once every 24 hours or more frequently if recommended by manufacturerLaboratories can assay QC samples more frequently if deemed necessary to ensure accurate resultsQC samples should be assayed after calibration or maintenance of analyzer to verify correct method performanceBlood gas measurements have separate, stricter QC requirementsCLIA requires at least 1 QC level to be assayed every 8 hours for blood gas measurementsIn addition to running QC samples every 8 hours for blood gas measurements, CLIA also requires control sample be run with every patient sample, unless analyzer calibrates itself every 30 minutes"
