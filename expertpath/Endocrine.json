as pure MCPV-negative tumors compared to MCPV-positive tumorsDecreased H3K27me3 expression with MCPV-negative tumors, especially those combined with cutaneous squamous cell carcinomaCombined MCC/squamous cell carcinoma in situ demonstrate clonal related this with shift to neuroendocrine phenotype associated with loss of RB protein, decreased H3K27me3, and increased SOX2 expression, suggesting epidermal origin of MCC from squamous dysplastic precursorsReports of increased nuclear polymorphism, more abundant cytoplasm, and higher Ki-67 proliferative indexAlthough there may be different pathogenic pathways for MCPV-positive and negative cases, recent DNA methylation patterns suggest common cellular origin of virus and UV-associated MCCDifferences in DNA methylation patterns appear to be due to viral (rather than mutation driven) carcinogenesis rather than distinct cells of originRisk FactorsImmunocompromised, particularly lymphoma/leukemia (particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia), solid organ transplant recipients (renal and cardiac transplant), other cancers, HIV, immunosuppressant drugs, arsenic exposureImmunocompromised patients have 5-50x increased risk MCCYounger age for MCC in immunocompromised patientsAlthough increased risk with immunosuppression, < 10% of patients with MCC are significantly immunocompromisedImmunosuppression in patients with MCC is associated with lower overall survivalImmunosuppressed patients with solid organ transplant have particularly low overall survivalImmunosuppression increases odds of greater nodal burden and lymphovascular invasionImmunosuppression suggested to be associated with MCPV-negative tumorsNatural and artificial sunlightRisk for developing MCC as 2nd malignancy in patients with multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), lymphoma, and malignant melanomaPatients with MCC at increased risk of developing subsequent cancer (salivary, biliary, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma) particularly during 1st year after diagnosisMCC can occur synchronous or metachronous with squamous and basal cell carcinomasMCC also occurs admixed with squamous cell and basal cell carcinomasCLINICAL ISSUESEpidemiologyIncidence1,600 new cases each year in United States (0.79 cases per 100,000 person years)Australia: 1.6 cases per 100,000 person years (highest incidence is Australia)MCPV-positive cases are more common in United States and EuropeMCPV-negative cases are more common in AustraliaIncidence increasing in past 20 years (aging population, increased prevalence of immunosuppression, more accurate diagnoses)Incidence in patients with CLL 40x higher than general populationIncidence in HIV-positive patients 10x higher than general populationIncidence in patients with solid organ transplant 5-10x higher than general populationInternational increasing incidence of MCC with average annual percentage change of 2.7% in United States, 1.8% in Queensland, Australia, 2% in New Zealand, 3.7% in Scotland, and 4% in NorwayIncidence increasing in both areas of low and high ambient UV radiation levels95% increase in incidence between 2002 and 2013AgeUsually older patients (i.e., 7th decade) but wide age range< 5% diagnosed at < 50 years of ageSexM > FEthnicityWhite populations most commonly affected (95%)PresentationUncommon, aggressive tumor occurring most often in sun-damaged skin (chronic sun exposure) of older patientsAEIOU (90% of MCC): Asymptomatic/nontender, Expanding rapidly, Immune suppression, Older than 50 years, and UV-exposed/fair skinHead and neck, particularly periorbital region, extremities, trunk and other sites (oral/nasal mucosa, anogenital region, breast, and stomach)Painless, fast-growing, solitary flesh-colored or erythematous nodule or plaqueBut may present at advanced stageOften localized disease at presentation, but metastasis may be seen in ~ 1/3High-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas in parotid gland may show UV genetic signature and may be metastases from cutaneous MCCImmunosuppression (organ transplant, CLL, among others)Paraneoplastic syndromes: Cerebellar degeneration, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, malignancy-associated hyponatremia, and possibly increased incidence severe hyponatremiaTreatmentWide local excision (aggressive surgical management correlated with better prognosis)High risk of local recurrence even with wide excisionSentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) (predictive of high short-term risk of recurrence or metastases), but may not be associated with overall favorable outcomeSLNB recommended for clinically localized MCCPredictors of false-negative SLNB: Male sex, age > 75 years, lymphovascular invasionPredictors of SLNB positivity: Tumor size, lymphovascular invasionNegative SLNB associated with low risk of same nodal basin recurrencesSLNB identifies metastatic disease in 1/3 with early-stage disease at presentationRecurrences may develop in majority with positive SLNB and in 39% with negative SLNBTherapeutic lymph node dissection (may prevent short-term regional lymph node recurrence)Radiation therapy following resection of primary site and lymph node basin and head and neck (may improve locoregional control)Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Little data availableChemotherapy: Often used in locally advanced or metastatic disease, but response often short-lived, and impact on overall survival uncertainUsed historically, generally utilized in patients whose tumors have not responded to immunotherapy or in whom immunotherapy is contraindicatedImmune checkpoint inhibition more frequently used in place of cytotoxic chemotherapy in advanced diseaseNewer treatments, such as inhibition of program death protein-1 (PD-1)/program death ligand-1 (PDL-1), show promise and may be helpful in cases not amenable to surgery &/or radiationProgrammed cell death-1 pathway inhibitors for advanced MCC may be associated with increased progression-free survival compared to chemotherapyImmune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PDL-1, such as avelumab and pembrolizumab, are approved for metastatic MCCImmune checkpoint inhibitors are used in both MCPV-positive and MCPV-negative MCCTrials of additional checkpoint inhibitors are underway, such as targeting antibodies to T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin containing domain 2, T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif domains, and lymphocyte activation gene-3Objective response rate of 32% in chemo refractory advanced disease and 56% as 1st-line therapy with metastatic diseaseImmunohistochemical PD-L1 quantitation does not appear to predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapyImmune checkpoint inhibitors are now 1st-line therapy for advanced MCCHowever, 50% with advanced MCC do not respond to immune checkpoint inhibitorsImmune checkpoint inhibitors may have limited application or contraindications in immunosuppressed and those with autoimmune diseaseImmune checkpoint inhibitors also may be associated with significant side effectsFuture targeted therapies being developed that hold promise for MCC

51% for local, 35% for nodal, and 14% for distant disease5-year overall survival 40% with clinically occult and 27% for clinically detected regional nodal basin involvement336 cases with clinically detected nodal disease and unknown primary tumor had better prognosis compared to cases presenting with concurrent primary tumor (42% vs. 27% survival)Up to 50% of patients with MCC die of disease4-5% of MCC are of unknown primary, but this represents 28-40% of MCC with clinically detected nodal diseaseMCC presenting with nodal disease alone (unknown primary) has better prognosis than those with metastatic nodal MCC and concurrent primary tumorMolecular profiling has been used to distinguish genetically distinct multiple primary MCC tumors from clonally related metastasesFrequent recurrencePrimary site of tumor may be prognostic indicator for MCC as tumors of scalp/neck had highest rate of cumulative incidence of MCC-specific mortality, and tumors of lip had highest cumulative incidence of MCC-specific mortality in MCC with regional metastases and distant metastases in recent SEER database studyPoor prognostic factors: Large size (5 cm), invasion of subcutis, diffuse growth, lack of brisk tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, male sex, recurrence, and metastatic diseaseReports MCPV-negative tumors may be more aggressive but not seen in all studiesMCC with brisk tumor infiltrating lymphocytes may have better prognosisVariety of histologic factors studied as possible prognostic factors: Tumor growth pattern, Breslow thickness, vascular density, mast cell counts, and lymphovascular invasion, but only lymphovascular invasion is generally usedMale sex, head and neck location, and underlying immunosuppression are negative prognostic factorsTumors presenting in lymph node without identifiable primary elsewhere have more favorable prognosis than those with known primary elsewherep63 immunoexpression may have worse outcome, but finding is unclearMACROSCOPICGeneral

cytoplasm in MCPV-negative casesNuclei can be variable in size, but intermediate cell type is most commonNumerous mitotic figures and apoptotic bodiesPresence of larger cell type and cases that show pleomorphism or clear cells may associated with MCPV-negative etiologyCan have intraepidermal component, and rare cases can be completely intraepidermalVery rare cases confined to the follicles and epidermisOften sheet-like or nested growthTrabecular pattern reflected in historical terminology is uncommon and often focal if presentOccasionally may have zones of geographic necrosisFrequent lymphatic invasionOften involves intratumoral or peritumoral lymphatics, including areas away from primary tumorUsually purely neuroendocrine tumor, but can occur admixed with carcinoma (basal cell, squamous cell, among others) or with mesenchymal componentsCan occur synchronous or metachronous with squamous cell or basal cell carcinomasMCC can be admixed with squamous cell or less commonly basal cell carcinoma or cutaneous adnexal tumor (combined MCC)Electron microscopy shows each component preserved, and transitional cell types not identifiedMCC combined with squamous cell carcinoma generally MCPV-negativeMCC can have glandular, melanocytic, striated muscle, lymphoepithelioma-like featuresRare biphenotypic or multiphenotypic tumors have been reportedCombined MCC more often have epidermotropism and involvement of adnexal structures than pure MCCCases of MCC primary to lymph node reported (up to 4-5% with unknown primary)Possible explanation for spontaneous regression of cutaneous primaryBetter survival than expected for metastatic MCC to lymph nodeNot possible to be certain which explanation most appropriate for these casesConsider MCC in differential diagnosis of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma in lymph node, even in patients without history of MCCNeuroendocrine granules have been identified in variety of common nonmelanocytic skin tumors, such as basal cell, sweat gland tumors, trichoblastoma, and trichofolliculomaRather nonspecific finding that correlates with plethora of reports of skin tumors showing focal staining for neuroendocrine markersHistologic features may be suggestive of MCPV-negative status, such as nuclear pleomorphism and more abundant cytoplasm, and combination of squamous cell carcinoma with MCC in MCPV-negative casesTumor infiltrating lymphocytes more common in MCPV-positive casesANCILLARY TESTSImmunohistochemistryPositive for CK20 (characteristic dot-like staining pattern; also seen in other low-molecular-weight keratins, e.g., CAM5.2); often paranuclear dot-like pattern for AE1/AE3CK7 often negative, but ~ 14% of MCC positive for both CK20 and CK7Rare cases reportedly CK7 positive and

immunologic response to tumor cells, or blockade of hormone effectsSigns and symptoms are not due to invasion or mass effect of tumorMay not necessarily correlate with stage of tumor, but may be first sign of clinically occult tumorTumors may secrete hormones in greater quantities (quantitatively abnormal) than corresponding normal cellsTumors may produce abnormal hormone product (i.e., precursor) or hormone or amine that corresponding normal tissue does not produceMany mechanisms have been suggested for ectopic or excess hormone production but poorly understoodClinical IssuesParaneoplastic syndromes may be presenting manifestation of neoplasm (and prompt search for underlying tumor) or may occur late in diseaseIndividuals with hypercalcemia of malignancy often present at advanced age and have limited survival, with median survival of 3-4 monthsEctopic hormones or substances may be used as markers for effectiveness of treatment and may herald recurrenceHypercalcemia is most common paraneoplastic syndromeMarkedly elevated calcium and often recent diagnosis of malignancy (lung, head and neck, skin, esophagus, breast, genitourinary, lymphoma, myeloma)Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone is 2nd most common paraneoplastic endocrine syndromeOther ectopic (paraneoplastic) syndromes include carcinoid syndrome, virilization, Cushing syndrome (ectopic ACTH causes 10-20% of Cushing syndrome), and tumor-induced hypoglycemia, among othersTERMINOLOGYSynonymsParaneoplastic endocrine syndromeEctopic hormone productionInappropriate hormone productionDefinitionsParaneoplastic syndromeCaused by substances (e.g., hormones, growth factors, cytokines, autoantibodies, biologically active amines, etc.) produced by tumor cells, immune response to tumor cells, or blockade hormone effectsSigns and symptoms are not due to direct invasion or mass effect of tumorETIOLOGY/PATHOGENESISAbnormal Hormone ProductionHormone or hormone-like substance can be produced by nonendocrine tumorsMost bioactive substances ectopically produced are peptides and hormones but can be biogenic amines, steroids, and thyroid hormonesTumors can secrete hormones in greater quantities than corresponding normal cells or abnormal hormone productTumor can produce > 1 hormoneTumor can secrete hormones or substances it does not normally secrete (ectopic)With new testing, many substances thought \"ectopic\" are identified in corresponding normal tissueTerm \"ectopic\" is now often used for types of hormone production or abnormal production of precursorsSymptoms of endocrine paraneoplastic syndromes cannot be attributed to secreting neoplastic lesion related to tumor's site, and is thus considered ectopicNonendocrine tumors may acquire ability to synthesize and secrete bioactive substancesMechanisms of Ectopic or Excessive Hormone ProductionMany mechanisms suggested for ectopic or excess hormone production but poorly understoodMolecular and cytogenetic abnormalitiesSomatic genetic rearrangements result in growth advantage or abnormal regulatione.g., lung cancer bHLH transcription factor hASH-1 highly expressed, resulting in ectopic ACTH productionAlterations of gene function may occur in tumor that activate genes regulating hormone synthesis and result in endocrine paraneoplastic syndromeInappropriate gene expression may occur, but mechanisms initiating ectopic hormone synthesis and secretion in neoplasia remain unknownCellular dedifferentiationPoorly differentiated malignancies may express substances normally expressed early in development in corresponding tissuesPossible cancer stem cells initiate tumors that express hormones or factors not normally produced by tissueCLINICAL ISSUESPresentationParaneoplastic syndromes may be presenting manifestation of neoplasm or may occur late in diseaseProduction of hormone or substance significant in associated clinical manifestations and morbidityEctopic hormones or substances may be markers for treatment effectiveness and can herald recurrencePrevalence of paraneoplastic syndrome ~ 8% among all malignant neoplasmsClinical manifestations may be clinically indistinguishable to those with tumor in expected site (eutopic hormonal secretion), which can cause diagnostic difficultiesMajority of endocrine paraneoplastic

corticotropin-releasing hormong (CRH) (Cushing syndrome)Growth hormone (GH) and GHRH (acromegaly)Luteinizing hormone (LH) (oligomenorrhea)Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) (VIPoma)Gastrin (gastrinoma)Functional status of pancreatic tumors is based on clinical symptoms caused by inappropriate hormonal secretion, not by immunohistochemical findingsHormone causing clinical syndrome can usually be detected by immunohistochemistryMany tumors are immunophenotypically multihormonal, but only 1 hormone usually associated with symptomsHistologic patterns are not specific for tumor type,

              "KEY FACTS": "Etiology/PathogenesisParaneoplastic (ectopic) syndromes are due to production of substances (hormones, growth factors, cytokines, or autoantibodies) by tumor cells, immunologic response to tumor cells, or blockade of hormone effectsSigns and symptoms are not due to invasion or mass effect of tumorMay not necessarily correlate with stage of tumor, but may be first sign of clinically occult tumorTumors may secrete hormones in greater quantities (quantitatively abnormal) than corresponding normal cellsTumors may produce abnormal hormone product (i.e., precursor) or hormone or amine that corresponding normal tissue does not produceMany mechanisms have been suggested for ectopic or excess hormone production but poorly understoodClinical IssuesParaneoplastic syndromes may be presenting manifestation of neoplasm (and prompt search for underlying tumor) or may occur late in diseaseIndividuals with hypercalcemia of malignancy often present at advanced age and have limited survival, with median survival of 3-4 monthsEctopic hormones or substances may be used as markers for effectiveness of treatment and may herald recurrenceHypercalcemia is most common paraneoplastic syndromeMarkedly elevated calcium and often recent diagnosis of malignancy (lung, head and neck, skin, esophagus, breast, genitourinary, lymphoma, myeloma)Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone is 2nd most common paraneoplastic endocrine syndromeOther ectopic (paraneoplastic) syndromes include carcinoid syndrome, virilization, Cushing syndrome (ectopic ACTH causes 10-20% of Cushing syndrome), and tumor-induced hypoglycemia, among othersTERMINOLOGYSynonymsParaneoplastic endocrine syndromeEctopic hormone productionInappropriate hormone productionDefinitionsParaneoplastic syndromeCaused by substances (e.g., hormones, growth factors, cytokines, autoantibodies, biologically active amines, etc.) produced by tumor cells, immune response to tumor cells, or blockade hormone effectsSigns and symptoms are not due to direct invasion or mass effect of tumorETIOLOGY/PATHOGENESISAbnormal Hormone ProductionHormone or hormone-like substance can be produced by nonendocrine tumorsMost bioactive substances ectopically produced are peptides and hormones but can be biogenic amines, steroids, and thyroid hormonesTumors can secrete hormones in greater quantities than corresponding normal cells or abnormal hormone productTumor can produce > 1 hormoneTumor can secrete hormones or substances it does not normally secrete (ectopic)With new testing, many substances thought \"ectopic\" are identified in corresponding normal tissueTerm \"ectopic\" is now often used for types of hormone production or abnormal production of precursorsSymptoms of endocrine paraneoplastic syndromes cannot be attributed to secreting neoplastic lesion related to tumor's site, and is thus considered ectopicNonendocrine tumors may acquire ability to synthesize and secrete bioactive substancesMechanisms of Ectopic or Excessive Hormone ProductionMany mechanisms suggested for ectopic or excess hormone production but poorly understoodMolecular and cytogenetic abnormalitiesSomatic genetic rearrangements result in growth advantage or abnormal regulatione.g., lung cancer bHLH transcription factor hASH-1 highly expressed, resulting in ectopic ACTH productionAlterations of gene function may occur in tumor that activate genes regulating hormone synthesis and result in endocrine paraneoplastic syndromeInappropriate gene expression may occur, but mechanisms initiating ectopic hormone synthesis and secretion in neoplasia remain unknownCellular dedifferentiationPoorly differentiated malignancies may express substances normally expressed early in development in corresponding tissuesPossible cancer stem cells initiate tumors that express hormones or factors not normally produced by tissue",

favor in nonfamilial casesSubtotal parathyroidectomy is indicated in familial syndromes, such as MEN1 and FIHPUsing surgical approach in HPT-JT is controversial because of increased risk of parathyroid cancerSubtotal parathyroidectomy with close postoperative biochemical monitoring for recurrence is recommended over prophylactic total parathyroidectomyResection of single gland, with intraoperative PTH monitoring≥ 50% drop in intraoperative PTH from baseline at 10 minutes after gland excision is helpful to ensure that abnormal gland(s) removedMedical therapy with calcimimetics useful for patients with who are poor surgical candidates or have nonlocalizable tumors or inoperable diseaseIntraoperative PTH drop of > 50% in 10-15 minutes after removal of parathyroid adenoma

parathyroid glands, 10% have ≥ 5 glands, and 3% have < 4 glandsParathyroid Adenoma Macroscopic FeaturesSingle enlarged gland: Usually 0.2 g to > 1 g, tan to pink-tan, encapsulated, ± rim of normal tissueOvoid, often surrounded by thin capsuleMay have rim of normal tissue (pale tan or yellow)Vary in size: < 1 cm to > 10 cmParathyroid adenomas < 0.6 cm and weighing < 100 mg may be referred to as \"microadenomas\"Very large adenomas have been referred to as \"giant\" adenomas (> 2 g), which often have more prominent fibrosis, irregularity in growth pattern, and hemorrhage than conventional adenomasFibrosis and hemorrhage in parathyroid adenomas may be associated with adherence (not invasion) of adenoma to surrounding structuresLarger adenomas may show fibrosis, hemosiderin, cystic degeneration, calcificationCystic change may occur in adenomas, particularly larger adenomas, and in those with HPT-JT syndromeAs parathyroid adenomas with cystic change are often large, they are often associated with higher serum calcium and PTH levelsAdenoma is ectopic in 10% (intrathyroidal, mediastinum, thymus, soft tissue behind esophagus, pharynx)Double adenomas often involve upper parathyroid glands (\"4th pouch disease\")MICROSCOPICHistologic FeaturesNormal parathyroid gland histologyNormal parathyroid glands can show significant variation in cellularity, even within single individualNormal parathyroid cellularity is distributed unevenly; it is high in infants and children and decreases with ageAge, sex, and constitutional factors (body fat, etc.) affect cellularity of normal parathyroidStromal fat 10-30% of parathyroid; increases with ageMore stromal fat in polar region of gland than centralConstituent cells of parathyroid glandParathyroid glands are composed of chief cells, transitional cells, oxyphil cells, and adipose tissueChief cells: 10 μm, polyhedral, round central nuclei, often scant eosinophilic to amphophilic cytoplasm, fat droplets (adults), and well-defined cytoplasmic membranesOncocytic/oxyphilic cells: 10-20 μm, abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm (mitochondria), appear at puberty, increase with age, may form nodulesTransitional cells: Smaller cells with less cytoplasmClear/water clear cells: Cells with clear cytoplasm (may be increased vacuolization in chief or oncocytic cells)Parathyroid adenoma Proliferation of parathyroid parenchymal chief cells, oncocytic/oxyphil cells, transitional cells, clear cells, or mixtures of cell typesMay have thin connective tissue capsule50-60% have rim of compressed, normal-appearing parathyroid tissueRim more often identified in small adenomasRim often separated from adenoma by connective tissue capsule, but not alwaysParathyroid parenchymal cells within rim are typically smaller than those within adenomaSuppressed parathyroid parenchymal cells within rim have larger and more fat droplets than in adenoma cells, which have less and more dispersed lipidMultiglandular parathyroid disease can also have rims of normal tissuePresence of rim of normal-appearing parathyroid tissue cannot distinguish parathyroid adenoma from multiglandular parathyroid diseaseDiseased parathyroid glands in MEN1 may lack rim of compressed, normal-appearing parathyroidFat cells sparse (scattered or nested) or absentStroma is sparse but vascular, may be fibrotic with hemosiderin deposition in large or cystic adenomasAdenoma cells may be larger than normal parathyroid cells and have more variably sized nucleiChief cells predominate in adenomas, but often mixture of oncocytic cells and clear cellsParathyroid adenomas composed of > 75% oncocytic cells account for 3-6% of parathyroid adenomas and are referred to as oncocytic parathyroid adenomasParathyroid adenomas composed entirely of clear cells (clear cell parathyroid adenoma) are very rareOften mixture of growth patterns: Solid, follicular, acinar, nests, cords, solid, rosette-like, and rarely papillaeAlthough uncommon, parathyroid adenomas can have predominantly follicular architecture and be mistaken for thyroid follicular neoplasmUnlike thyroid, parathyroid has well-defined cell membranes and lacks birefringent calcium oxalate crystalsNuclear palisading around blood vessels is commonFoci of \"endocrine atypia\" with pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei (up to 25% of cases)Scattered mitoses in up to 80% of adenomas (more in parathyroid carcinoma)Usually < 1 mitosis/10 HPFNo atypical mitosesCysts and cystic change and degeneration common, especially in large adenomasCystic change can also be seen in adenomas in MEN1 and HPT-JTMay have fibrous bands due to degenerative changes, fibrosis, and hemosiderinFibrous bands and fibrosis common in both parathyroid adenoma and parathyroid carcinomaNo angiolymphatic invasion, perineural invasion, or invasion into adjacent structuresParathyroid adenomas in MEN1 are histologically similar to sporadic parathyroid adenomas, but MEN1-associated adenomas often show multinodular proliferations of cells, usually chief but oncocytic or clear cells can be seenParathyroid adenoma in MEN1 may lack compressed rim of normal-appearing parathyroid tissue often seen in sporadic adenomasMEN4 parathyroid disease histologically similar MEN1Cystic change can be seen in sporadic parathyroid adenomas and in adenomas of MEN1 and HPT-JTParathyroid adenomas with CDC73 mutations (parafibromin deficient) may have cystic change, prominent vascularity, staghorn vessels, sheet-like growth, perinuclear clearing, and eosinophilic cytoplasmParathyroid adenoma cannot

cells arranged in scattered nests or anastomosing trabeculae or acinar formations amid abundant mature adipose tissueMust differentiate from normal parathyroid tissue (intraoperative PTH monitoring very helpful)Must differentiate from parathyroid lipohyperplasia since parathyroid adenoma generally affects one gland rather than multiple glandsExceptional cases have oncocytic cells (rather than chief cells) in anastomosing trabeculae or acinar formations (oncocytic lipoadenoma)Weights are variable: 0.5-420.0 gEctopic parathyroid adenomaIntrathyroidal, mediastinum, thymus, soft tissue behind

nuclear parafibromin positivity, and many carcinomas show parafibromin lossComplete loss of nuclear (or possibly nucleolar parafibromin) in parathyroid carcinoma is helpful differentiating from adenoma, which usually shows intact nuclear and nucleolar parafibromin expressionTumors with loss of nucleolar parafibromin expression only (with preserved nuclear parafibromin expression) may be associated with parathyroid carcinoma, but studies are limitedComplete loss of nuclear parafibromin in all tumor cells with nonneoplastic cells showing preserved staining is \"parafibromin deficient\" parathyroid tumorParafibromin deficiency indicates biallelic CDC73 inactivation and is often associated with germline CDC73 mutationMajority of parafibromin deficient parathyroid tumors are associated with germline CDC73 mutation, but biallelic somatic only CDC73 mutations can occurComplete loss of parafibromin nuclear staining (parafibromin deficiency) is concerning for parathyroid carcinoma but can be seen in adenomas associated with CDC73 mutation (HPT-JT)Parathyroid carcinomas in hemodialysis patients can show nuclear parafibromin staining in parathyroid carcinomas and metastasisParafibromin nuclear expression may be lost in parathyroid adenomas associated with CDC73 germline mutationParafibromin is helpful, but requires rigorously controlled testing as variability exists among laboratoriesIncreased p27 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein) in parathyroid adenomas compared to carcinomasParathyroid adenomas are positive for p27, BCL2, and MDM2, and have low

earlier than parathyroid adenomas)SexMale and female patients equally affected (unlike adenomas, which are more frequent in females)SiteArises in parathyroid glandSimilar to parathyroid adenomas, carcinomas can occur in ectopic sites and sites where developmental parathyroid tissue may be identifiedSlightly more common in lower parathyroid glandsPresentationParathyroid tumors are usually 1st manifestation of HPT-JT, occur in > 95%, and 15% are malignantMost PCs are functional and patients are more often symptomatic than with benign parathyroid disease, but rare nonfunctional tumors can occurFatigue, weakness, weight loss, nausea, polyuria, polydipsia, renal disease, bone diseaseBone disease (osteitis fibrosa cystica, diffuse osteopenia, subperiosteal resorption, skull involvement) common in carcinomaRenal disease (nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, decreased renal function) common in carcinomaProminent symptoms, particularly renal and bone involvement, concerning for malignancyRecurrent laryngeal nerve involvement (vocal cord disruption and hoarseness) highly worrisome for malignancyAdenomas and atypical parathyroid tumors are usually asymptomatic or have vague, mild symptomsPalpable neck mass (unusual for atypical parathyroid tumor and highly unusual for parathyroid adenoma)Local recurrence of adenoma or atypical parathyroid tumor is worrisome for carcinoma

mediastinal lymph nodes, lung, bone, and liverFrequent locoregional progression after surgeryAverage time between surgery and first recurrence is 3 years, but recurrences may be delayed for decadesMetastatic sites: Lymph node (#1 metastatic site), lung (#1 distant metastatic site), bone, and liverDeath is usually due to uncontrollable hypercalcemiaTreatmentSurgical approaches1st-line treatment is en block resection of parathyroid tumor and surrounding structures, usually ipsilateral thyroid lobe at 1st surgery (better local control and disease-free survival)Risk progression associated with margin statusDrugsInoperable PC management may include calcimimetics to control hypercalcemia and bisphosphonates to control bone resorptionChemotherapy effectiveness unclearFew reports of immunomodulating therapeutic approaches with vaccinesRadiationPatients treated with surgery and postoperative radiation may have lower risk of locoregional progression and improved cause-specific survivalPrognosis5-year survival: Up to 85%; 10-year survival: 49%Best chance for cure is surgical resection en bloc with adjacent tissues, often ipsilateral thyroid lobePostoperative radiation may be associated with decreased risk progression and improved survivalExtensive surgery associated with improved survival as completeness of tumor excision is associated with increased survivalPoor prognostic features include large tumor size, older age, gross local invasion, angiolymphatic invasion, and metastatic diseaseLoss of parafibromin expression; presence of galectin

growth (invasion into adjacent structures; capsular, vascular, or perineural invasion)Invasive growth required for diagnosis of malignancyEvaluation of entire parathyroid gland is required to rule out invasionAdenomas and atypical parathyroid tumors may be adherent to adjacent structures, but they are not invasiveCapsular invasion of tumor beyond thickened capsule in 60%, diagnostic of malignancyEntrapment of cells in capsule can occur in adenomas and atypical parathyroid tumors, especially if cystic or fibrotic (must distinguish from true invasion)Many parathyroid tumors, including carcinomas, lack true fibrous capsuleFibrous bands common (up to 90%) but not diagnostic of PCParathyroid adenomas and atypical parathyroid tumors can be fibrotic, especially if cystic or degenerativeCaution in parathyroid glands previously traumatized (e.g., fine-needle aspiration)Secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism can also show fibrous bandsInvasion of vessels in capsule or soft tissue is most specific feature for carcinoma, but seen in only 15%Artifactual dislodgement of tumor cells floating in vessels must be differentiated from true vascular invasion with tumor cells at least partially attached to vessel wall and may or may not be surrounded by endothelial cellsPerineural invasion is diagnostic of malignancySolid growth with sheets of cells, closely packed nests,

carcinomasCellular monotony, but occasional cases pleomorphicHigh nuclear:cytoplasmic ratiosProminent nucleoli (macronucleoli)Foci of pleomorphic cells with hyperchromatic nuclei should not be mistaken for carcinoma, as \"endocrine atypia\" is seen in benign parathyroid lesionsMitotic figures identified in at least 80% of carcinomas and up to 70% of adenomasMitotic activity more prominent

in sporadic and HPT-JT parathyroid lesions are similar, HPT-JT lesions may be cystic (although less frequently than previously thought)Histologic features suggestive of underlying germline CDC73

tumorsOverexpression of p53, positivity for PGP9.5, galectin 3, hTERT, and loss of expression of APC, E-cadherin, p27, BCL2, MDM2, and 5-hmC may be helpful in evaluation of parathyroid tumors but appear more helpful when used in combinations than as single markersCarcinomas have higher Ki-67 proliferative index than adenomas and atypical parathyroid tumorsPCs usually have Ki-67 proliferative index > 5%, while adenomas and atypical parathyroid tumors are usually < 5%Keratin 14 reported negative in oxyphil carcinomas and positive in oncocytic adenomasParafibrominEncoded by CDC73, parafibromin often shows complete nuclear absence in PC, both in familial and sporadic cases, and is often present/retained in sporadic adenomas and atypical parathyroid tumorsIn HPT-JT, parathyroid disease (benign or malignant) usually shows loss of parafibromin nuclear immunostaining reflecting underlying CDC73 mutationTumor with complete absence of nuclear staining of parafibromin in all tumor cells with nonneoplastic cells showing preserved staining is \"parafibromin deficient\"Although partial loss or reduction of parafibromin nuclear staining (rather than complete absence) may suggest possibility of CDC73 mutation, this may be due to technical issues and difficulties in staining processComplete absence of nuclear parafibromin staining in all tumor cells with nonneoplastic cells showing preserved staining is how \"parafibromin-deficient\" neoplasm is definedTumors with retained nuclear parafibromin but loss of nucleolar parafibromin may be associated with CDC73 mutation, but this is less certain than complete absence of all nuclear staining in all tumor cells as is required for designation of \"parafibromin deficient\"Loss of nucleolar parafibromin raises possibility of underlying genetic abnormality, and genetic testing is suggestedIndividuals with no family history of parathyroid disease with parafibromin-deficient parathyroid neoplasm should undergo CDC73 gene sequencing for possibility of underlying germline mutation, which can occur de novoMost parafibromin-deficient tumors are associated with germline CDC73 mutation, but somatic inactivating CDC73 mutations, often in combination with loss of remaining allele or biallelic somatic only mutations, can occur but are less commonPCs in hemodialysis patients can show staining in primary and metastasisAbsence of nuclear parafibromin loss immunohistochemically does not rule out possibility of underlying CDC73 mutation, as some point mutations in CDC73 may not be associated with loss of nuclear parafibromin expressionParafibromin nuclear expression may be preserved in HPT-JT syndrome as some point mutations in CDC73 may not be associated with loss of nuclear parafibromin expression,

nodular and asymmetric pattern of growth often containing more oncocytic cellsChief cells usually predominate, but chief cells and oncocytic cells can form nodular areasNodularity may increase with increasing renal failure, making glands indistinguishable from primary multiglandular parathyroid disease or tertiary hyperplasiaImportant for pathologist to be informed of type of parathyroid disease patient has clinicallyParathyroid glands involved in secondary parathyroid hyperplasia can have markedly irregular contours and fibrosis and are at risk of being mistaken for parathyroid carcinoma,

setting of chronic renal failure) develop autonomously functioning parathyroid glandParathyroid CarcinomaOften symptomatic, high serum calcium (> 13 mg/dL)Involves one parathyroid gland, not multiple (although rare reports of carcinoma arising in setting of multiglandular parathyroid disease, particularly secondary hyperplasia)Caution must be used in evaluating parathyroid glands in setting of secondary parathyroid hyperplasia as they can show markedly irregular contours and fibrosis that could be difficult to differentiate from parathyroid carcinoma, particularly if pathologist is not apprised of underlying clinical settingUnequivocal invasion (capsular, vascular, perineural, or invasion into adjacent structures)Often shows diffuse loss of nuclear parafibromin staining in all tumor

immunologic response to tumor cells, or blockade of hormone effectsSigns and symptoms are not due to invasion or mass effect of tumorMay not necessarily correlate with stage of tumor, but may be first sign of clinically occult tumorTumors may secrete hormones in greater quantities (quantitatively abnormal) than corresponding normal cellsTumors may produce abnormal hormone product (i.e., precursor) or hormone or amine that corresponding normal tissue does not produceMany mechanisms have been suggested for ectopic or excess hormone production but poorly understoodClinical IssuesParaneoplastic syndromes may be presenting manifestation of neoplasm (and prompt search for underlying tumor) or may occur late in diseaseIndividuals with hypercalcemia of malignancy often present at advanced age and have limited survival, with median survival of 3-4 monthsEctopic hormones or substances may be used as markers for effectiveness of treatment and may herald recurrenceHypercalcemia is most common paraneoplastic syndromeMarkedly elevated calcium and often recent diagnosis of malignancy (lung, head and neck, skin, esophagus, breast, genitourinary, lymphoma, myeloma)Syndrome of inappropriate

can be produced by nonendocrine tumorsMost bioactive substances ectopically produced are peptides and hormones but can be biogenic amines, steroids, and thyroid hormonesTumors can secrete hormones in greater quantities than corresponding normal cells or abnormal hormone productTumor can produce > 1 hormoneTumor can secrete hormones or substances it does not normally secrete (ectopic)With new testing, many substances thought \"ectopic\" are identified in corresponding normal tissueTerm \"ectopic\" is now often used for types of hormone production or abnormal production of precursorsSymptoms of endocrine paraneoplastic syndromes cannot be attributed to secreting neoplastic lesion related to tumor's site, and is thus considered ectopicNonendocrine tumors may acquire ability to synthesize and secrete bioactive substancesMechanisms of Ectopic or Excessive Hormone ProductionMany mechanisms suggested for ectopic or excess hormone production but poorly understoodMolecular and cytogenetic abnormalitiesSomatic genetic rearrangements result in growth advantage or abnormal regulatione.g., lung cancer bHLH transcription factor hASH-1 highly expressed, resulting in ectopic ACTH productionAlterations of gene function may occur in tumor that activate genes regulating hormone synthesis and result in endocrine paraneoplastic syndromeInappropriate gene expression may occur, but mechanisms initiating ectopic hormone synthesis and secretion in neoplasia remain unknownCellular dedifferentiationPoorly differentiated malignancies may express substances normally expressed early in development in corresponding tissuesPossible cancer stem cells initiate tumors that express hormones or factors not normally produced by tissueCLINICAL ISSUESPresentationParaneoplastic syndromes may be presenting manifestation of neoplasm or may occur late in diseaseProduction of hormone or substance significant in associated clinical manifestations and morbidityEctopic hormones or substances may be markers for treatment effectiveness and can herald recurrencePrevalence of paraneoplastic syndrome ~ 8% among all malignant neoplasmsClinical manifestations may be clinically indistinguishable to those with tumor in expected site (eutopic hormonal secretion), which can cause diagnostic difficultiesMajority of endocrine paraneoplastic syndromes occurring in nonendocrine tumors occur in highly malignant tumorsMost common: Lung, breast, prostate, ovary, skin, colon, lymphoproliferativeHowever, can occur with almost any tumor typeBenign and low-grade tumors can have paraneoplastic syndromesTreatmentRemove underlying tumorIf tumor cannot be removed, inhibit hormone secretione.g., bisphosphonates and possibly denosumab may be useful in intractable hypercalcemiaCinacalcet may help PTHrP-related hypercalcemiaHypercalcemiaMost common paraneoplastic endocrine syndromeUp to 30% of hospitalized patients with underlying malignancy have hypercalcemiaPoor prognostic factor; 30-day mortality up to 50%Often recent diagnosis of malignancy and markedly elevated serum calciumTumors: Lung, head and neck, skin, esophagus, breast, genitourinary, lymphoma, myelomaOccurs without metastases or altered parathyroid functionSymptomatic when calcium levels markedly elevatedFatigue, dehydration, nephrolithiasis, bone pain,

pheochromocytoma, small cell lungOverproduction of PTHrP, which acts as circulating humoral factor and also binds PTH receptorTissues producing PTHrP in development (skin, marrow, breast) may produce it in malignancyPTHrP also produced by bone metastasesGrowth factors released by osteolytic metastases result in PTHrP secretion and increased calciumMost often with squamous cell carcinomas and squamous cell lung cancer, but can occur with lymphoma, multiple myeloma, renal cell carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, and neuroendocrine tumorsPTHrP-related hypercalcemia is most common (80%) mechanism of endocrine tumor-related hypercalcemiaColorectal carcinomas with PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia associated with advanced metastatic disease, severe hypercalcemia, and high mortalityNonendocrine neoplasia-induced hypercalcemia can occur with breast and testicular malignancies, multiple myeloma, and other lymphoproliferative disordersPTHrP causes increased RANKL production by activating osteoclasts and is associated with bone resorption with calcium released into bloodReabsorption of renal calcium causing increased serum calcium can be caused by PTHrPTumors produce enzyme to convert

familial syndromesStudy of primary hyperparathyroidism in setting of familial syndromes has provided insight into genetic and molecular changes that underlie neoplastic transformation of parathyroid tissueMost common genetic syndromes associated with primary hyperparathyroidism are multiple endocrine neoplasia types 1, 4, 2A, and 5 (MEN1, MEN4, MEN2A, and MEN5), hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome (HPT-JT), familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (FIHP), and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemiaHPT-JT (CDC73-related disorder)Autosomal dominantInactivating mutations in CDC73 (HRPT2)

favor in nonfamilial casesSubtotal parathyroidectomy is indicated in familial syndromes, such as MEN1 and FIHPUsing surgical approach in HPT-JT is controversial because of increased risk of parathyroid cancerSubtotal parathyroidectomy with close postoperative biochemical monitoring for recurrence is recommended over prophylactic total parathyroidectomyResection of single gland, with intraoperative PTH monitoring≥ 50% drop in intraoperative PTH from baseline at 10 minutes after gland excision is helpful to ensure that abnormal gland(s) removedMedical therapy with calcimimetics useful for patients with who are poor surgical candidates or have nonlocalizable tumors or inoperable diseaseIntraoperative PTH drop of > 50% in 10-15 minutes after removal of parathyroid adenoma

parathyroid glands, 10% have ≥ 5 glands, and 3% have < 4 glandsParathyroid Adenoma Macroscopic FeaturesSingle enlarged gland: Usually 0.2 g to > 1 g, tan to pink-tan, encapsulated, ± rim of normal tissueOvoid, often surrounded by thin capsuleMay have rim of normal tissue (pale tan or yellow)Vary in size: < 1 cm to > 10 cmParathyroid adenomas < 0.6 cm and weighing < 100 mg may be referred to as \"microadenomas\"Very large adenomas have been referred to as \"giant\" adenomas (> 2 g), which often have more prominent fibrosis, irregularity in growth pattern, and hemorrhage than conventional adenomasFibrosis and hemorrhage in parathyroid adenomas may be associated with adherence (not invasion) of adenoma to surrounding structuresLarger adenomas may show fibrosis, hemosiderin, cystic degeneration, calcificationCystic change may occur in adenomas, particularly larger adenomas, and in those with HPT-JT syndromeAs parathyroid adenomas with cystic change are often large, they are often associated with higher serum calcium and PTH levelsAdenoma is ectopic in 10% (intrathyroidal, mediastinum, thymus, soft tissue behind esophagus, pharynx)Double adenomas often involve upper parathyroid glands (\"4th pouch disease\")MICROSCOPICHistologic FeaturesNormal parathyroid gland histologyNormal parathyroid glands can show significant variation in cellularity, even within single individualNormal parathyroid cellularity is distributed unevenly; it is high in infants and children and decreases with ageAge, sex, and constitutional factors (body fat, etc.) affect cellularity of normal parathyroidStromal fat 10-30% of parathyroid; increases with ageMore stromal fat in polar region of gland than centralConstituent cells of parathyroid glandParathyroid glands are composed of chief cells, transitional cells, oxyphil cells, and adipose tissueChief cells: 10 μm, polyhedral, round central nuclei, often scant eosinophilic to amphophilic cytoplasm, fat droplets (adults), and well-defined cytoplasmic membranesOncocytic/oxyphilic cells: 10-20 μm, abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm (mitochondria), appear at puberty, increase with age, may form nodulesTransitional cells: Smaller cells with less cytoplasmClear/water clear cells: Cells with clear cytoplasm (may be increased vacuolization in chief or oncocytic cells)Parathyroid adenoma Proliferation of parathyroid parenchymal chief cells, oncocytic/oxyphil cells, transitional cells, clear cells, or mixtures of cell typesMay have thin connective tissue capsule50-60% have rim of compressed, normal-appearing parathyroid tissueRim more often identified in small adenomasRim often separated from adenoma by connective tissue capsule, but not alwaysParathyroid parenchymal cells within rim are typically smaller than those within adenomaSuppressed parathyroid parenchymal cells within rim have larger and more fat droplets than in adenoma cells, which have less and more dispersed lipidMultiglandular parathyroid disease can also have rims of normal tissuePresence of rim of normal-appearing parathyroid tissue cannot distinguish parathyroid adenoma from multiglandular parathyroid diseaseDiseased parathyroid glands in MEN1 may lack rim of compressed, normal-appearing parathyroidFat cells sparse (scattered or nested) or absentStroma is sparse but vascular, may be fibrotic with hemosiderin deposition in large or cystic adenomasAdenoma cells may be larger than normal parathyroid cells and have more variably sized nucleiChief cells predominate in adenomas, but often mixture of oncocytic cells and clear cellsParathyroid adenomas composed of > 75% oncocytic cells account for 3-6% of parathyroid adenomas and are referred to as oncocytic parathyroid adenomasParathyroid adenomas composed entirely of clear cells (clear cell parathyroid adenoma) are very rareOften mixture of growth patterns: Solid, follicular, acinar, nests, cords, solid, rosette-like, and rarely papillaeAlthough uncommon, parathyroid adenomas can have predominantly follicular architecture and be mistaken for thyroid follicular neoplasmUnlike thyroid, parathyroid has well-defined cell membranes and lacks birefringent calcium oxalate crystalsNuclear palisading around blood vessels is commonFoci of \"endocrine atypia\" with pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei (up to 25% of cases)Scattered mitoses in up to 80% of adenomas (more in parathyroid carcinoma)Usually < 1 mitosis/10 HPFNo atypical mitosesCysts and cystic change and degeneration common, especially in large adenomasCystic change can also be seen in adenomas in MEN1 and HPT-JTMay have fibrous bands due to degenerative changes, fibrosis, and hemosiderinFibrous bands and fibrosis common in both parathyroid adenoma and parathyroid carcinomaNo angiolymphatic invasion, perineural invasion, or invasion into adjacent structuresParathyroid adenomas in MEN1 are histologically similar to sporadic parathyroid adenomas, but MEN1-associated adenomas often show multinodular proliferations of cells, usually chief but oncocytic or clear cells can be seenParathyroid adenoma in MEN1 may lack compressed rim of normal-appearing parathyroid tissue often seen in sporadic adenomasMEN4 parathyroid disease histologically similar MEN1Cystic change can be seen in sporadic parathyroid adenomas and in adenomas of MEN1 and HPT-JTParathyroid adenomas with CDC73 mutations (parafibromin deficient) may have cystic change, prominent vascularity, staghorn vessels, sheet-like growth, perinuclear clearing, and eosinophilic cytoplasmParathyroid adenoma cannot be distinguished from multiglandular parathyroid disease on histologic features of single glandParathyroid Adenoma VariantsParathyroid microadenomaParathyroid adenoma < 100 mg and < 0.6 cmOncocytic (oxyphilic) parathyroid adenomaBenign encapsulated neoplasm composed exclusively or predominantly (> 75%) of mitochondrion-rich oncocytes3-6% of parathyroid adenomasSimilar age, female predominance, and serum calcium as conventional parathyroid adenomas but often larger sizeOriginally thought nonfunctional but now well-recognized as functional and cause of hyperparathyroidismOncocytic cells

chief cells or artifactParathyroid lipoadenomaBenign tumor/hamartoma with abundant mature adipose tissue and only scattered nests of parenchymal cellsRare cause of hyperparathyroidismParenchymal chief cells arranged in scattered nests or anastomosing trabeculae or acinar formations amid abundant mature adipose tissueMust differentiate from normal parathyroid tissue (intraoperative PTH monitoring very helpful)Must differentiate from parathyroid lipohyperplasia since parathyroid adenoma generally affects one gland rather than multiple glandsExceptional cases have oncocytic cells (rather than chief cells) in anastomosing trabeculae or acinar formations (oncocytic lipoadenoma)Weights are variable: 0.5-420.0 gEctopic parathyroid adenomaIntrathyroidal, mediastinum, thymus, soft tissue behind esophagus and pharynxThymus or mediastinal parathyroid adenomas usually derive from inferior parathyroid glandsIntrathyroidal parathyroid adenoma is usually derived from superior parathyroid

nuclear parafibromin positivity, and many carcinomas show parafibromin lossComplete loss of nuclear (or possibly nucleolar parafibromin) in parathyroid carcinoma is helpful differentiating from adenoma, which usually shows intact nuclear and nucleolar parafibromin expressionTumors with loss of nucleolar parafibromin expression only (with preserved nuclear parafibromin expression) may be associated with parathyroid carcinoma, but studies are limitedComplete loss of nuclear parafibromin in all tumor cells with nonneoplastic cells showing preserved staining is \"parafibromin deficient\" parathyroid tumorParafibromin deficiency indicates biallelic CDC73 inactivation and is often associated with germline CDC73 mutationMajority of parafibromin deficient parathyroid tumors are associated with germline CDC73 mutation, but biallelic somatic only CDC73 mutations can occurComplete loss of parafibromin nuclear staining (parafibromin deficiency) is concerning for parathyroid carcinoma but can be seen in adenomas associated with CDC73 mutation (HPT-JT)Parathyroid carcinomas in hemodialysis patients can show nuclear parafibromin staining in parathyroid carcinomas and metastasisParafibromin nuclear expression may be lost in parathyroid adenomas associated with CDC73 germline mutationParafibromin is helpful, but requires rigorously controlled testing as variability exists among laboratoriesIncreased p27 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein) in parathyroid adenomas compared to carcinomasParathyroid adenomas are positive for p27, BCL2, and MDM2, and have low

earlier than parathyroid adenomas)SexMale and female patients equally affected (unlike adenomas, which are more frequent in females)SiteArises in parathyroid glandSimilar to parathyroid adenomas, carcinomas can occur in ectopic sites and sites where developmental parathyroid tissue may be identifiedSlightly more common in lower parathyroid glandsPresentationParathyroid tumors are usually 1st manifestation of HPT-JT, occur in > 95%, and 15% are malignantMost PCs are functional and patients are more often symptomatic than with benign parathyroid disease, but rare nonfunctional tumors can occurFatigue, weakness, weight loss, nausea, polyuria, polydipsia, renal disease, bone diseaseBone disease (osteitis fibrosa cystica, diffuse osteopenia, subperiosteal resorption, skull involvement) common in carcinomaRenal disease (nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, decreased renal function) common in carcinomaProminent symptoms, particularly renal and bone involvement, concerning for malignancyRecurrent laryngeal nerve involvement (vocal cord disruption and hoarseness) highly worrisome for malignancyAdenomas and atypical parathyroid tumors are usually asymptomatic or have vague, mild symptomsPalpable neck mass (unusual for atypical parathyroid tumor and highly unusual for parathyroid adenoma)Local recurrence of adenoma or atypical parathyroid tumor is worrisome for carcinoma but can be parathyromatosisLaboratory TestsExtremely high serum calcium (> 13 mg/dL) more common in carcinomaMarkedly elevated PTH levels (> 1,000 ng/L)Serum PTH is usually > 3x and often > 10x higher

mediastinal lymph nodes, lung, bone, and liverFrequent locoregional progression after surgeryAverage time between surgery and first recurrence is 3 years, but recurrences may be delayed for decadesMetastatic sites: Lymph node (#1 metastatic site), lung (#1 distant metastatic site), bone, and liverDeath is usually due to uncontrollable hypercalcemiaTreatmentSurgical approaches1st-line treatment is en block resection of parathyroid tumor and surrounding structures, usually ipsilateral thyroid lobe at 1st surgery (better local control and disease-free survival)Risk progression associated with margin statusDrugsInoperable PC management may include calcimimetics to control hypercalcemia and bisphosphonates to control bone resorptionChemotherapy effectiveness unclearFew reports of immunomodulating therapeutic approaches with vaccinesRadiationPatients treated with surgery and postoperative radiation may have lower risk of locoregional progression and improved cause-specific survivalPrognosis5-year survival: Up to 85%; 10-year survival: 49%Best chance for cure is surgical resection en bloc with adjacent tissues, often ipsilateral thyroid lobePostoperative radiation may be associated with decreased risk progression and improved survivalExtensive surgery associated with improved survival as completeness of tumor excision is associated with increased survivalPoor prognostic features include large tumor size, older age, gross local invasion, angiolymphatic invasion, and metastatic diseaseLoss of parafibromin expression; presence of galectin positivitySignificant risk of locoregional progression after surgeryIMAGINGGeneral FeaturesMass on US, CT, or MR; often no specific featuresTc-99m sestamibi scintigraphy or US identifies location but does not separate benign from malignantMACROSCOPICGeneral FeaturesFirm tumors; may be adherent or invasive of adjacent structuresMay be grossly encapsulated and resemble adenomas or atypical parathyroid tumorsCaution as large adenomas, especially cystic, can be fibrotic and adhere to adjacent structuresFirm to pink-tan cut section often with lobulated appearance due to fibrotic bandsSizeMean: 6.7 g (range: 1.5-27 g); 30-49 mm; larger than adenomas and atypical parathyroid tumors, but overlap existsMICROSCOPICHistologic FeaturesHypercellular parathyroid tumor with invasive growth (invasion into adjacent structures; capsular, vascular, or perineural invasion)Invasive growth required for diagnosis of malignancyEvaluation of entire parathyroid gland is required to rule out invasionAdenomas and atypical parathyroid tumors may be adherent to adjacent structures, but they are not invasiveCapsular invasion of tumor beyond thickened capsule in 60%, diagnostic of malignancyEntrapment of cells in capsule can occur in adenomas and atypical parathyroid tumors, especially if cystic or fibrotic (must distinguish from true invasion)Many parathyroid tumors, including carcinomas, lack true fibrous capsuleFibrous bands common (up to 90%) but not diagnostic of PCParathyroid adenomas and atypical parathyroid tumors can be fibrotic, especially if cystic or degenerativeCaution in parathyroid glands previously traumatized (e.g., fine-needle aspiration)Secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism can also show fibrous bandsInvasion of vessels in capsule or soft tissue is most specific feature for carcinoma, but seen in only 15%Artifactual dislodgement of tumor cells floating in vessels must be differentiated from true vascular invasion with tumor cells at least partially attached to vessel wall and may or may not be surrounded by endothelial cellsPerineural invasion is diagnostic of malignancySolid growth with sheets of cells, closely packed nests, or trabeculae, but can be follicular or other patternsProminent growth patterns (follicular and acinar) common in adenomas, may be seen in atypical parathyroid tumors, but less common in carcinomasCellular monotony, but occasional cases pleomorphicHigh nuclear:cytoplasmic ratiosProminent nucleoli (macronucleoli)Foci of pleomorphic cells with hyperchromatic nuclei should not be mistaken for carcinoma, as \"endocrine atypia\" is seen in benign parathyroid lesionsMitotic figures identified in at least 80% of carcinomas and up to 70% of adenomasMitotic activity more prominent in carcinomas than adenomasAtypical mitoses limited to PCSuggested that triad of macronucleoli, > 5 mitoses per 50 HPF, and necrosis is associated with aggressive behavior in PCAlthough gross features in sporadic and HPT-JT parathyroid lesions are similar, HPT-JT lesions may be cystic (although less frequently than previously thought)Histologic features suggestive of underlying germline CDC73 mutation: Sheet-like (rather than acinar) growth, arborizing or staghorn vessels, nuclear enlargement with occasional multinucleation, eosinophilic cytoplasm, and perinuclear cytoplasmic clearingPC can be composed entirely of oncocytes (oncocytic PC) or clear cells (clear cell PC)Same criteria used to diagnose these as conventional PCANCILLARY TESTSImmunohistochemistryPositive for chromogranin A

epithelial neuroendocrine neoplasms, but often lack INSM1Negative for TTF-1, thyroglobulin, and monoclonal PAX8Immunohistochemical markers suggested in distinguishing benign from malignant parathyroid tumorsOverexpression of p53, positivity for PGP9.5, galectin 3, hTERT, and loss of expression of APC, E-cadherin, p27, BCL2, MDM2, and 5-hmC may be helpful in evaluation of parathyroid tumors but appear more helpful when used in combinations than as single markersCarcinomas have higher Ki-67 proliferative index than adenomas and atypical parathyroid tumorsPCs usually have Ki-67 proliferative index > 5%, while adenomas and atypical parathyroid tumors are usually < 5%Keratin 14 reported negative in oxyphil carcinomas and positive in oncocytic adenomasParafibrominEncoded by CDC73, parafibromin often shows complete nuclear absence in PC, both in familial and sporadic cases, and is often present/retained in sporadic adenomas and atypical parathyroid tumorsIn HPT-JT, parathyroid disease (benign or malignant) usually shows loss of parafibromin nuclear immunostaining reflecting underlying CDC73 mutationTumor with complete absence of nuclear staining of parafibromin in all tumor cells with nonneoplastic cells showing preserved staining is \"parafibromin deficient\"Although partial loss or reduction of parafibromin nuclear staining (rather than complete absence) may suggest possibility of CDC73 mutation, this may be due to technical issues and difficulties in staining processComplete absence of nuclear parafibromin staining in all tumor cells with nonneoplastic cells showing preserved staining is how \"parafibromin-deficient\" neoplasm is definedTumors with retained nuclear parafibromin but loss of nucleolar parafibromin may be associated with CDC73 mutation, but this is less certain than complete absence of all nuclear staining in all tumor cells as is required for designation of \"parafibromin deficient\"Loss of nucleolar parafibromin raises possibility of underlying genetic abnormality, and genetic testing is suggestedIndividuals with no family history of parathyroid disease with parafibromin-deficient parathyroid neoplasm should undergo CDC73 gene sequencing for possibility of underlying germline mutation, which can occur de novoMost parafibromin-deficient tumors are associated with germline CDC73 mutation, but somatic inactivating CDC73 mutations, often in combination with loss of remaining allele or biallelic somatic only mutations, can occur but are less commonPCs in hemodialysis patients can show staining in primary and metastasisAbsence of nuclear parafibromin loss immunohistochemically does not rule out possibility of underlying CDC73 mutation, as some point mutations in CDC73 may not be associated with loss of nuclear parafibromin expressionParafibromin nuclear expression may be preserved in HPT-JT syndrome as some point mutations in CDC73 may not be associated with loss of nuclear parafibromin expression, thus preserved nuclear parafibromin does not exclude CDC73 mutationLoss of parafibromin can occur with somatic CDC73 mutation; often occurs in sporadic carcinomasParafibromin immunostain is helpful,

accounts for 15% of primary hyperparathyroidism [single parathyroid adenomas (80-85%), carcinomas (1%)]Incidence increased in past 3 decades with increased calcium screening with multichannel autoanalyzerPrimary multiglandular parathyroid disease occurs in 90% of patients with MEN1 and 30% with MEN2AHistorically, 20% of individuals with primary multiglandular parathyroid disease thought to have MEN, but with increasing genetic evaluation, more cases of apparently primary parathyroid hyperplasia are being identified as associated underlying pathogenic aberration and are clonal processes and considered neoplastic primary multinodular parathyroid disease (multiple parathyroid adenomas/multiglandular parathyroid adenomatosis)Prevalence of 7% in autopsy study (patients did have elevated serum calcium but no bone disease)Age5th decade but wide rangeFamilial cases (many now regarded as clonal primary multiglandular parathyroid disease) occur earlier (25 years of age)SexF:M = 2:1Females and males equally affected in familial cases, which are now regarded as primary multiglandular parathyroid disease (primary multiglandular parathyroid adenomatosis/multiglandular parathyroid adenomas)SiteIn 50% of cases, all 4 parathyroid glands symmetrically enlargedCaution with asymmetric multiglandular diseasePresentationClinical presentation changed from individuals presenting with nephrocalcinosis and osteopenia to those presenting today with weakness and lethargy or asymptomatic with elevated screening serum calciumClinically similar to parathyroid adenomaDuring pregnancy, may cause nephrolithiasis, hypertension, preeclampsia, decreased bone mineral densityLaboratory TestsSerum calcium elevated but less than parathyroid carcinoma in which calcium often > 13 mg/dLHypophosphatemiaTreatmentSurgical approachesSubtotal parathyroidectomy with 3 glands removed, leaving vascularized remnant of 4th glandOr total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation of portion of parathyroid gland into neck or forearmDifficult or impossible to differentiate primary multiglandular parathyroid disease from adenoma based only on histologic examination of single glandRapid intraoperative PTH measurements decrease risk of missing multiglandular parathyroid disease and help confirm removal of diseased parathyroid gland(s)Residual tissue may become hyperplastic, requiring additional surgeryMACROSCOPICNormal Parathyroid GlandSize and shape of kidney bean (4-6 mm x 2-4 mm), 20-40 mg eachMost people have 4, 10% have ≥ 5, and 3% have < 4 parathyroid glandsPrimary Parathyroid Hyperplasia50% symmetric enlargement of all 4 glands, but others report that in 2/3 of cases, only 2 glands appeared enlargedAsymmetric hyperplasia or pseudoadenomatous variant of hyperplasia with marked variation in extent of glandular involvement is easily confused with adenoma(s)MEN1-associated multiglandular parathyroid disease is often asymmetric and clonal (multiple adenomatosis)Surgeons and pathologists must be cautious in evaluating parathyroid glands in relation to size and cellularity, as these parameters can vary greatly within single patient with multiglandular parathyroid diseaseAsymmetrically enlarged gland can be misinterpreted as parathyroid adenomaOccult pattern of involvement may show subtle enlargement and subtle microscopic features of hypercellularity (difficult to differentiate from normal)Cystic change not uncommonMICROSCOPICHistologic FeaturesNormal parathyroid glandCan show variation in cellularity even in single individualNormal parathyroid cellularity variable, distributed unevenly, high in infants/children, decreases with ageAge, sex, constitutional factors (body fat), etc. affect cellularity of normal parathyroid glandsStromal fat constitutes 10-30%, increases with ageMore fat in polar regions of parathyroid than centralConstituent cells of parathyroid glandParathyroid glands composed of chief, transitional, and oxyphil cells and adipose tissueChief cells: 10 μm, polyhedral, round central nuclei, eosinophilic to amphophilic cytoplasm, fat droplets (adults), well-defined cytoplasmic membranesOncocytic (oxyphilic) cells: 10-20 μm with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, appearing at puberty, and increasing with age; may form nodules with increasing age and be mistaken for parathyroid diseaseTransitional cells: Smaller parenchymal cells, less cytoplasmClear/water clear cells: Parenchymal cells with clear cytoplasm (may be due to increased vacuolization in chief or oxyphilic cells)Primary parathyroid hyperplasia histologyIncrease in parenchymal cell mass of multiple parathyroid glandsChief cell is predominant, but oncocytic, transitional, and clear cells may be presentSporadic and hereditary forms of primary multiglandular disease may be histologically indistinguishableParathyroid multiglandular parathyroid disease in MEN1 usually involves increased numbers of chief cells that may have nodular or diffuse patternMEN1-associated hyperplasia often asymmetricHypercellular chief cells arranged in cords, nests, sheets, or follicular structuresCystic change can be seenNodular or diffuse growth (nodular is most common pattern in primary hyperplasia)Nodules usually pure populations of chief, oncocytic, or clear cells (less fat in nodules than internodular or diffuse areas)Caution: Oncocytic cells increase with age, may form nodules (do not confuse with hypercellular)Study of sporadic primary multiglandular parathyroid disease found diffuse growth more prevalent in young patients with moderate hypercalcemia and moderately enlarged glands with little variability in size or morphologic patternsNodular primary multiglandular parathyroid disease more frequent in older patients; asymmetric, variable cellularity with more oncocytic cellsMEN1-associated primary multiglandular parathyroid disease usually shows increase in chief cells and may have nodular or diffuse growth pattern (often asymmetric multiglandular parathyroid disease) and is now thought to be clonalPrimary water clear cell primary multiglandular parathyroid disease shows increase in clear cells and diffuse rather than nodular growthStromal fat is decreased, but regional variations in stromal fat even among glands in single individual (pitfall in evaluating small biopsies)Scattered mitotic figures may be seen, but more mitoses and atypical mitoses in carcinomaCells show slight variation in size and shapeFoci of endocrine atypia with pleomorphism and hyperchromasia (more common in adenomas)Rim of normal parathyroid tissue can be seen, although less common than in adenomaFibrosis and hemosiderin, especially in markedly enlarged glands or glands with cystic degenerationCystic change uncommon but can be seen in markedly enlarged glandsNo capsular, vascular, or perineural invasion or invasion into adjacent structuresHistologic features in HPT-JT-associated cases similar to sporadic lesions, but HPT-JT cases often cysticPrimary multiglandular parathyroid disease variantsClear (water-clear) cell primary multiglandular parathyroid

highest in normal parathyroid, followed by hyperplasia, adenoma, and carcinomaKi-67 lower in hyperplasia and adenomas than carcinomasParafibromin nuclear immunostaining generally retained unless in setting of CDC73-related disorder (HPT-JT)Genetic TestingPrimary multiglandular parathyroid disease often clonal, particularly in nodular areas and in MEN1 (multiglandular parathyroid tumors); more cases that would historically have been considered parathyroid hyperplasia are now known to be clonal or multiclonal and regarded as neoplastic and primary multiglandular parathyroid diseaseSpecific genetic abnormalities in idiopathic primary parathyroid hyperplasia not as well defined as in hereditary forms of hyperparathyroidismWith increasing recognition of underlying germline genetic abnormalities in what were historically thought to be cases of primary parathyroid hyperplasia, hereditary primary parathyroid hyperplasia appears to be more common than previously thoughtMEN1 mutation (tumor suppressor gene, 11q13, results in truncated menin protein)Primary multiglandular parathyroid disease (primary multiglandular parathyroid adenomas/primary multiglandular parathyroid adenomatosis) is most common manifestation of MEN1 (90% of MEN1 have primary multiglandular parathyroid disease)Autosomal dominant, high penetrance, germline mutation in MEN1 tumor suppressor gene (11q13) encodes menin (truncated with MEN1 mutation)Sporadic MEN1 cases due to new mutationsAlthough historically referred to as parathyroid hyperplasia, recent studies demonstrate clonality (multiglandular parathyroid tumors) in what is now referred to as primary multiglandular parathyroid disease (primary multiglandular parathyroid adenomas/primary multiglandular parathyroid adenomatosis)Somatic MEN1 mutations in 15-20% of sporadic parathyroid adenomas and some sporadic carcinomasGenetic diagnosis to identify germline MEN1 mutations has facilitated appropriate targeting of clinical, biochemical, and radiologic screeningMEN1 mutation detection rate increases with family history of MEN1MEN1 mutation detection rate increases with number of MEN1-related tumors and in patients with both parathyroid and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumorsRET mutation (protooncogene, 10q21)RET germline activating protooncogene mutation in MEN2A (autosomal dominant; high penetrance; 95%

cancerGermline CDC73 mutations identified in subset of patients with mutation-positive carcinomasDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSISParathyroid AdenomaBenign neoplasm composed of chief, oxyphil, transitional, and water clear cells or mixture of cell types affecting single parathyroid glandDifficult/impossible to differentiate primary parathyroid hyperplasia from parathyroid adenoma based only on histologic examination of 1 glandDistinguishing parathyroid adenoma from hyperplasia usually requires examination of at least 1 additional gland, which should be normalHyperplasia shows enlargement of at least 2 glands, while adenoma typically involves single glandRim of normal tissue in 50-60% of parathyroid adenomas but can occasionally be seen in hyperplasiaPrimary Clear Cell HyperplasiaDiffuse increase in clear cells rather than nodular growth of predominantly chief cells in primary multiglandular parathyroid diseaseLipohyperplasiaRare; can occur as sporadic form and with familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcemiaIncrease in adipose tissue and myxoid change in parathyroid glands associated with hyperfunctionEnlarged parathyroid glands with abundant stromal fat can be microscopically confused with normal parathyroidSecondary Parathyroid HyperplasiaSecondary (adaptive) increase in PTH due to hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia (renal failure, vitamin D deficiency, pseudohypoparathyroidism, etc.) in which physiologic stimulus leads to compensatory hyperplasiaIncreased PTH due to low serum calcium caused byDisorders of vitamin D (rickets, vitamin D deficiency, or malabsorption)Disorders of phosphate metabolism (malnutrition or malabsorption, renal disease, aluminum toxicity)Tissue resistance to vitamin D, hypomagnesemia, pseudohypoparathyroidism, and calcium deficiencyOften, history of chronic renal failure (most common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism)Parathyroid glands show more diffusely hyperplastic changes than in primary hyperparathyroidism in which glands may show more nodular and asymmetric pattern of growth often containing more oncocytic cellsChief cells usually predominate, but chief cells and oncocytic cells can form nodular areasNodularity may increase with increasing renal failure, making glands indistinguishable from primary multiglandular parathyroid disease or tertiary hyperplasiaImportant for pathologist to be informed of type of parathyroid disease patient has clinicallyParathyroid glands involved in secondary parathyroid hyperplasia can have markedly irregular contours and fibrosis and are at risk of being mistaken for parathyroid carcinoma, particularly if patient has underlying disease status that has not been provided to pathologistTertiary HyperplasiaRare condition in which patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (most often in setting of chronic renal failure) develop autonomously functioning parathyroid glandParathyroid CarcinomaOften symptomatic, high serum calcium (> 13 mg/dL)Involves one parathyroid gland, not multiple (although rare reports of carcinoma arising in setting of multiglandular parathyroid disease, particularly secondary hyperplasia)Caution must be used in evaluating parathyroid glands in setting of secondary parathyroid hyperplasia as they can show markedly irregular contours and fibrosis that could be difficult to differentiate from parathyroid carcinoma, particularly if pathologist is not apprised of underlying clinical settingUnequivocal invasion (capsular, vascular, perineural, or invasion into adjacent structures)Often shows diffuse loss of nuclear parafibromin staining in all tumor cells with retention of staining in associated normal tissue (may be due to somatic or germline CDC73 mutation)ParathyromatosisRecurrent hyperparathyroidism after subtotal parathyroidectomy may result from multiple small nests of parathyroid cells in neck or mediastinum from lesional tissue left behind or from stimulation of embryonic nests of parathyroid cellsDIAGNOSTIC CHECKLISTClinically Relevant Pathologic FeaturesMultiglandular parathyroid adenomatosis/adenomas is replacing term \"hyperplasia\" in increasing numbers of cases as they are found to be clonal and have underlying pathogenic germline genetic abnormality (such as MEN1)Mild, nonspecific symptoms or asymptomatic and identified by screening serum calciumPathologic Interpretation PearlsNormal parathyroid has significant variation in cellularity in and among glands (caution small biopsies)Distinguishing parathyroid tissue from thyroid: Well-demarcated cytoplasmic membranes, lack of colloid, cytoplasmic lipid, rounder nuclei, and denser chromatinSymmetric enlargement of all 4 glands only in subset of cases, many show enlargement of < 4 glandsBe very cautious in attempting to diagnose multiple adenomas (most likely asymmetric hyperplasia)Rims of normal tissue occasionally seen in parathyroid hyperplasiaBe aware of parathyroid hyperplasia variants (lipohyperplasia and clear cell
