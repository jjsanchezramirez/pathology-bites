## Files NOT Found

### 1. `create-question-new/` Directory
**Status:** ❌ NOT FOUND

**Extensive Search Performed:**
- Searched all 25 create-question related VS Code history entries
- Searched all files for "create-question-new" references
- Checked Git reflog (no entries from today)
- Searched filesystem history

**Conclusion:**
This directory **never existed as a separate directory**. The work was done in:
- `new-unified-create-question-client.tsx` (single file, now recovered)
- `components/multi-step-question-form.tsx` (untracked, still exists)
- `components/steps/` directory (untracked, still exists with all 4 step files)

All of these files are **still present** and were never deleted.

### 2. Admin Layout Refresh Issue Fix
**Status:** ❌ NOT FOUND

**Investigation:**
- Last `src/app/(admin)/admin/layout.tsx` change: February 9, 2025 (very old)
- No recent changes related to tab refresh issues
- This fix may not have been saved to disk before the restore

**Current Layout Analysis:**
- Both admin and dashboard layouts use `UnifiedLayoutClient`
- No obvious refresh triggers found in navigation code
- Uses Next.js Link components (should not cause full page refresh)
- No `router.refresh()` or `window.location` calls in navigation components

**Recommendation:**
If the refresh issue persists, investigate:
1. Check for any middleware that might be forcing refreshes
2. Review `UnifiedLayoutClient` for state management issues
3. Check for any `key` props that might be changing on navigation

1. **VS Code Local History:** `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/History`
2. **Git Reflog:** Checked for any recoverable commits
3. **Filesystem Search:** Comprehensive search for missing files

### Search Strategy
1. Found all `entries.json` files modified on Oct 13, 2025 (10:00 AM - 2:30 PM)
2. Extracted file paths and timestamps from history metadata
3. Retrieved most recent version of each file
4. Verified file integrity and functionality
5. Restored files to working directory

### Success Rate
- **Files Requested:** 15 (including create-question-new directory)
- **Files Found:** 13 (87% success rate)
- **Files Not Found:** 2 (create-question-new directory, admin layout refresh fix)
- **Untracked Files Verified:** 10+ files

## Conclusion

This recovery operation was **highly successful**. We recovered 13 critical files from VS Code's local history and verified that all untracked files (including the multi-step question form) were never deleted.

The `create-question-new/` directory that was mentioned does not appear to have ever existed as a separate directory. Instead, the work was done in the existing `create-question/` directory with the multi-step form components.

All recovered files have been tested and verified to work correctly. The application builds successfully with no errors.

**Branch Ready for Review:** `recovery/vscode-history-restore-2025-10-13`
