### Architecture Principles

- **Feature-based organization**: Each feature is self-contained with its own components, hooks, services, and types
- **Shared resources**: Common utilities, UI components, and services are centralized in the `shared` directory
- **Route grouping**: Next.js route groups organize pages by user type (admin, auth, dashboard, public)
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with strict configuration
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with unit and E2E tests

## 🧪 Development

### Development Workflow

This project follows modern development practices with comprehensive tooling:

#### Code Quality & Standards
```bash
# Linting and code formatting
npm run lint              # Check for linting errors
npm run lint:fix          # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run type-check        # TypeScript type checking
npm run cleanup           # Clean dependencies and fix issues
```

#### Testing Strategy
```bash
# Unit Testing (Jest + Testing Library)
npm run test              # Run all tests
npm run test:watch        # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage     # Generate coverage report
npm run test:auth         # Run authentication-specific tests

# End-to-End Testing (Playwright)
npm run test:e2e          # Run E2E tests headlessly
npm run test:e2e:ui       # Run E2E tests with UI
```

#### Development Modes
```bash
# Development servers
npm run dev               # Standard development server
npm run dev:turbo         # Faster development with Turbo

# Build and production
npm run build             # Production build
npm run start             # Start production server
npm run clean             # Clean build artifacts
```

### Working with Tailwind CSS v4

This project uses the latest Tailwind CSS v4 with updated syntax:

- **Color opacity**: Use `-50%` format instead of `/50` (e.g., `bg-blue-500-50%`)
- **Arbitrary properties**: Use `--` prefix (e.g., `[--mask-type:luminance]`)
- **Preflight**: CSS reset is separate from `@tailwind base`
- **Modern features**: Enhanced performance and smaller bundle sizes

### Feature Development Guidelines

When developing new features:

1. **Create feature directory** in `src/features/[feature-name]/`
2. **Organize by concern**: components, hooks, services, types, utils
3. **Export from index.ts** for clean imports
4. **Write tests** for components and utilities
5. **Update shared types** if needed
6. **Follow TypeScript strict mode** requirements

### Database Development

Working with Supabase:

```bash
# Database types are auto-generated
# Update src/shared/types/supabase.ts when schema changes

# Test database connections
npm run test:auth         # Test auth flows
```

### Component Development

Using shadcn/ui components:

```bash
# Add new UI components
npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component-name]

# Components are automatically added to src/shared/components/ui/
```
