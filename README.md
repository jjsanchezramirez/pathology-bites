```bash
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint
```

### Testing

### Working with Tailwind CSS v4

This project uses Tailwind CSS v4 with its updated syntax:

- Color opacity uses the `-50%` format instead of `/50` (e.g., `bg-blue-500-50%`)
- Arbitrary properties use the `--` prefix (e.g., `[--mask-type:luminance]`)
- Note that preflight (CSS reset) is now separate from `@tailwind base`

## 🚢 Deployment
